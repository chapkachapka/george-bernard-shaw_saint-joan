  <h2 class="c008">PREFACE TO SAINT JOAN</h2>
</div>

<h3 class="c009" id="c1">Joan the Original and Presumptuous.</h3>

<p class="c010">Joan of Arc, a village girl from the Vosges, was
born about 1412; burnt for heresy, witchcraft, and
sorcery in 1431; rehabilitated after a fashion in
1456; designated Venerable in 1904; declared
Blessed in 1908; and finally canonized in 1920.
She is the most notable Warrior Saint in the Christian
calendar, and the queerest fish among the
eccentric worthies of the Middle Ages. Though a
professed and most pious Catholic, and the projector
of a Crusade against the Husites, she was in fact one
of the first Protestant martyrs. She was also one
of the first apostles of Nationalism, and the first
French practitioner of Napoleonic realism in warfare
as distinguished from the sporting ransom-gambling
chivalry of her time. She was the pioneer
of rational dressing for women, and, like Queen
Christina of Sweden two centuries later, to say nothing
of the Chevalier D’Eon and innumerable obscure
heroines who have disguised themselves as men to
serve as soldiers and sailors, she refused to accept the
specific woman’s lot, and dressed and fought and
lived as men did.</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="pageno" id="Page_vi">vi</span>As she contrived to assert herself in all these ways
with such force that she was famous throughout western
Europe before she was out of her teens (indeed
she never got out of them), it is hardly surprising
that she was judicially burnt, ostensibly for a number
of capital crimes which we no longer punish as
such, but essentially for what we call unwomanly
and insufferable presumption. At eighteen Joan’s
pretensions were beyond those of the proudest Pope
or the haughtiest emperor. She claimed to be the
ambassador and plenipotentiary of God, and to be,
in effect, a member of the Church Triumphant whilst
still in the flesh on earth. She patronized her own
king, and summoned the English king to repentance
and obedience to her commands. She lectured, talked
down, and overruled statesmen and prelates. She
poohpoohed the plans of generals, leading their
troops to victory on plans of her own. She had an
unbounded and quite unconcealed contempt for
official opinion, judgment, and authority, and for
War Office tactics and strategy. Had she been a
sage and monarch in whom the most venerable hierarchy
and the most illustrious dynasty converged,
her pretensions and proceedings would have been as
trying to the official mind as the pretensions of
Caesar were to Cassius. As her actual condition
was pure upstart, there were only two opinions
about her. One was that she was miraculous: the
other that she was unbearable.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
  <h3 class="c009" id="c2">Joan and Socrates.</h3>
</div>

<p class="c010">If Joan had been malicious, selfish, cowardly or
stupid, she would have been one of the most odious
persons known to history instead of one of the most
attractive. If she had been old enough to know the
effect she was producing on the men whom she humiliated
by being right when they were wrong, and had
learned to flatter and manage them, she might have
lived as long as Queen Elizabeth. But she was too
young and rustical and inexperienced to have any
such arts. When she was thwarted by men whom she
thought fools, she made no secret of her opinion of
them or her impatience with their folly; and she was
naïve enough to expect them to be obliged to her for
setting them right and keeping them out of mischief.
Now it is always hard for superior wits to understand
the fury roused by their exposures of the
stupidities of comparative dullards. Even Socrates,
for all his age and experience, did not defend himself
at his trial like a man who understood the long
accumulated fury that had burst on him, and was
clamoring for his death. His accuser, if born 2300
years later, might have been picked out of any first
class carriage on a suburban railway during the
evening or morning rush from or to the City; for
he had really nothing to say except that he and his
like could not endure being shewn up as idiots every
time Socrates opened his mouth. Socrates, unconscious
<span class="pageno" id="Page_viii">viii</span>of this, was paralyzed by his sense that somehow
he was missing the point of the attack. He
petered out after he had established the fact that he
was an old soldier and a man of honorable life, and
that his accuser was a silly snob. He had no suspicion
of the extent to which his mental superiority
had roused fear and hatred against him in the hearts
of men towards whom he was conscious of nothing but
good will and good service.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c3">Contrast with Napoleon.</h3>

<p class="c010">If Socrates was as innocent as this at the age of
seventy, it may be imagined how innocent Joan was
at the age of seventeen. Now Socrates was a man
of argument, operating slowly and peacefully on
men’s minds, whereas Joan was a woman of action,
operating with impetuous violence on their bodies.
That, no doubt, is why the contemporaries of Socrates
endured him so long, and why Joan was
destroyed before she was fully grown. But both of
them combined terrifying ability with a frankness,
personal modesty, and benevolence which made the
furious dislike to which they fell victims absolutely
unreasonable, and therefore inapprehensible by
themselves. Napoleon, also possessed of terrifying
ability, but neither frank nor disinterested, had no
illusions as to the nature of his popularity. When
he was asked how the world would take his death, he
said it would give a gasp of relief. But it is not so
<span class="pageno" id="Page_ix">ix</span>easy for mental giants who neither hate nor intend
to injure their fellows to realize that nevertheless
their fellows hate mental giants and would like to
destroy them, not only enviously because the juxtaposition
of a superior wounds their vanity, but quite
humbly and honestly because it frightens them. Fear
will drive men to any extreme; and the fear inspired
by a superior being is a mystery which cannot be
reasoned away. Being immeasurable it is unbearable
when there is no presumption or guarantee of its
benevolence and moral responsibility: in other words,
when it has no official status. The legal and conventional
superiority of Herod and Pilate, and of
Annas and Caiphas, inspires fear; but the fear, being
a reasonable fear of measurable and avoidable
consequences which seem salutary and protective, is
bearable; whilst the strange superiority of Christ
and the fear it inspires elicit a shriek of Crucify Him
from all who cannot divine its benevolence. Socrates
has to drink the hemlock, Christ to hang on the cross,
and Joan to burn at the stake, whilst Napoleon,
<a id="tn-sthelena"/>though he ends in St Helena, at least dies in his bed
there; and many terrifying but quite comprehensible
official scoundrels die natural deaths in all the glory
of the kingdoms of this world, proving that it is far
more dangerous to be a saint than to be a conqueror.
Those who have been both, like Mahomet and Joan,
have found that it is the conqueror who must save
the saint, and that defeat and capture mean martyrdom.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_x">x</span>Joan was burnt without a hand lifted on her
own side to save her. The comrades she had led to
victory and the enemies she had disgraced and defeated,
the French king she had crowned and the
English king whose crown she had kicked into the
Loire, were equally glad to be rid of her.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c4">Was Joan Innocent or Guilty?</h3>

<p class="c010">As this result could have been produced by a
crapulous inferiority as well as by a sublime superiority,
the question which of the two was operative in
Joan’s case has to be faced. It was decided against
her by her contemporaries after a very careful and
conscientious trial; and the reversal of the verdict
<span class="nonstandard">twentyfive</span> years later, in form a rehabilitation of
Joan, was really only a confirmation of the validity
of the coronation of Charles VII. It is the more
impressive reversal by a unanimous Posterity, culminating
in her canonization, that has quashed the
original proceedings, and put her judges on their
trial, which, so far, has been much more unfair than
their trial of her. Nevertheless the rehabilitation
of 1456, corrupt job as it was, really did produce
evidence enough to satisfy all reasonable critics that
Joan was not a common termagant, not a harlot,
not a witch, not a blasphemer, no more an idolater
than the Pope himself, and not ill conducted in any
sense apart from her soldiering, her wearing of men’s
clothes, and her audacity, but on the contrary good-humored,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xi">xi</span>an intact virgin, very pious, very temperate
(we should call her meal of bread soaked in the common
wine which is the drinking water of France ascetic),
very kindly, and, though a brave and hardy
soldier, unable to endure loose language or licentious
conduct. She went to the stake without a stain on
her character except the overweening presumption,
the superbity as they called it, that led her thither.
It would therefore be waste of time now to prove that
the Joan of the first part of the Elizabethan chronicle
play of Henry VI (supposed to have been tinkered
by Shakespear) grossly libels her in its concluding
scenes in deference to Jingo patriotism. The mud
that was thrown at her has dropped off by this time
so completely that there is no need for any modern
writer to wash up after it. What is far more difficult
to get rid of is the mud that is being thrown
at her judges, and the whitewash which disfigures her
beyond recognition. When Jingo scurrility had
done its worst to her, sectarian scurrility (in this
case Protestant scurrility) used her stake to beat the
Roman Catholic Church and the Inquisition. The
easiest way to make these institutions the villains of
a melodrama was to make The Maid its heroine. That
melodrama may be dismissed as rubbish. Joan got
a far fairer trial from the Church and the Inquisition
than any prisoner of her type and in her situation
gets nowadays in any official secular court; and
the decision was strictly according to law. And she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xii">xii</span>was not a melodramatic heroine: that is, a physically
beautiful lovelorn parasite on an equally beautiful
hero, but a genius and a saint, about as completely
the opposite of a melodramatic heroine as it is
possible for a human being to be.</p>

<p class="c011">Let us be clear about the meaning of the terms.
A genius is a person who, seeing farther and probing
deeper than other people, has a different set of ethical
valuations from theirs, and has energy enough
to give effect to this extra vision and its valuations
in whatever manner best suits his or her specific
talents. A saint is one who having practised heroic
virtues, and enjoyed revelations or powers of the
order which The Church classes technically as supernatural,
is eligible for canonization. If a historian
is an Anti-Feminist, and does not believe women to
be capable of genius in the traditional masculine departments,
he will never make anything of Joan,
whose genius was turned to practical account mainly
in soldiering and politics. If he is Rationalist enough
to deny that saints exist, and to hold that new ideas
cannot come otherwise than by conscious ratiocination,
he will never catch Joan’s likeness. Her ideal
biographer must be free from nineteenth century
prejudices and biases; must understand the Middle
Ages, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Holy
Roman Empire much more intimately than our Whig
historians have ever understood them; and must be
capable of throwing off sex partialities and their
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>romance, and regarding woman as the female of the
human species, and not as a different kind of animal
with specific charms and specific imbecilities.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c5">Joan’s Good Looks.</h3>

<p class="c010">To put the last point roughly, any book about
Joan which begins by describing her as a beauty may
be at once classed as a romance. Not one of Joan’s
comrades, in village, court, or camp, even when they
were straining themselves to please the king by
praising her, ever claimed that she was pretty. All
the men who alluded to the matter declared most
emphatically that she was unattractive sexually to a
degree that seemed to them miraculous, considering
that she was in the bloom of youth, and neither ugly,
awkward, deformed, nor unpleasant in her person.
The evident truth is that like most women of her
hardy managing type she seemed neutral in the conflict
of sex because men were too much afraid of
her to fall in love with her. She herself was not
sexless: in spite of the virginity she had vowed up
to a point, and preserved to her death, she never
excluded the possibility of marriage for herself. But
marriage, with its preliminary of the attraction, pursuit,
and capture of a husband, was not her business:
she had something else to do. Byron’s formula,
“Man’s love is of man’s life a thing apart: ’tis
woman’s whole existence” did not apply to her any
more than to George Washington or any other
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>masculine worker on the heroic scale. Had she lived
in our time, picture postcards might have been sold
of her as a general: they would not have been sold of
her as a sultana. Nevertheless there is one reason for
crediting her with a very remarkable face. A sculptor
of her time in Orleans made a statue of a helmeted
young woman with a face that is unique in art in
point of being evidently not an ideal face but a
portrait, and yet so uncommon as to be unlike any
real woman one has ever seen. It is surmised that
Joan served unconsciously as the sculptor’s model.
There is no proof of this; but those extraordinarily
spaced eyes raise so powerfully the question “If this
woman be not Joan, who is she?” that I dispense
with further evidence, and challenge those who disagree
with me to prove a negative. It is a wonderful
face, but quite neutral from the point of view
of the operatic beauty fancier.</p>

<p class="c011">Such a fancier may perhaps be finally chilled by
the prosaic fact that Joan was the defendant in a
suit for breach of promise of marriage, and that she
conducted her own case and won it.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c6">Joan’s Social Position.</h3>

<p class="c010">By class Joan was the daughter of a working
farmer who was one of the headmen of his village,
and transacted its feudal business for it with the
neighboring squires and their lawyers. When the
castle in which the villagers were entitled to take
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xv">xv</span>refuge from raids became derelict, he organized a
combination of half a dozen farmers to obtain possession
of it so as to occupy it when there was any
danger of invasion. As a child, Joan could please
herself at times with being the young lady of this
castle. Her mother and brothers were able to follow
and share her fortune at court without making themselves
notably ridiculous. These facts leave us no
excuse for the popular romance that turns every
heroine into either a princess or a beggarmaid. In
the somewhat similar case of Shakespear a whole
inverted pyramid of wasted research has been based
on the assumption that he was an illiterate laborer,
in the face of the plainest evidence that his father
was a man of business, and at one time a very prosperous
one, married to a woman of some social pretensions.
There is the same tendency to drive Joan
into the position of a hired shepherd girl, though a
hired shepherd girl in Domrémy would have deferred
to her as the young lady of the farm.</p>

<p class="c011">The difference between Joan’s case and Shakespear’s
is that Shakespear was not illiterate. He had
been to school, and knew as much Latin and Greek
as most university passmen retain: that is, for practical
purposes, none at all. Joan was absolutely illiterate.
“I do not know A from B” she said. But
many princesses at that time and for long after might
have said the same. Marie Antoinette, for instance,
at Joan’s age could not spell her own name correctly.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>But this does not mean that Joan was an ignorant
person, or that she suffered from the diffidence and
sense of social disadvantage now felt by people who
cannot read or write. If she could not write letters,
she could and did dictate them and attach full and
indeed excessive importance to them. When she was
called a shepherd lass to her face she very warmly resented
it, and challenged any woman to compete
with her in the household arts of the mistresses of
well furnished houses. She understood the political
and military situation in France much better than
most of our newspaper fed university women-graduates
understand the corresponding situation of their
own country today. Her first convert was the neighboring
commandant at Vaucouleurs; and she converted
him by telling him about the defeat of the
Dauphin’s troops at the Battle of Herrings so long
before he had official news of it that he concluded
she must have had a divine revelation. This knowledge
of and interest in public affairs was nothing extraordinary
among farmers in a warswept countryside.
Politicians came to the door too often sword
in hand to be disregarded: Joan’s people could not
afford to be ignorant of what was going on in the
feudal world. They were not rich; and Joan worked
on the farm as her father did, driving the sheep to
pasture and so forth; but there is no evidence or suggestion
of sordid poverty, and no reason to believe
that Joan had to work as a hired servant works, or
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>indeed to work at all when she preferred to go to
confession, or dawdle about waiting for visions and
listening to the church bells to hear voices in them.
In short, much more of a young lady, and even of
an intellectual, than most of the daughters of our
petty bourgeoisie.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c7">Joan’s Voices and Visions.</h3>

<p class="c010">Joan’s voices and visions have played many tricks
with her reputation. They have been held to prove
that she was mad, that she was a liar and imposter,
that she was a sorceress (she was burnt for this),
and finally that she was a saint. They do not prove
any of these things; but the variety of the conclusions
reached shew how little our matter-of-fact
historians know about other people’s minds, or even
about their own. There are people in the world
whose imagination is so vivid that when they have an
idea it comes to them as an audible voice, sometimes
uttered by a visible figure. Criminal lunatic asylums
are occupied largely by murderers who have
obeyed voices. Thus a woman may hear voices telling
her that she must cut her husband’s throat and strangle
her child as they lie asleep; and she may feel
obliged to do what she is told. By a medico-legal
superstition it is held in our courts that criminals
whose temptations present themselves under these
illusions are not responsible for their actions, and
must be treated as insane. But the seers of visions
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>and the hearers of revelations are not always criminals.
The inspirations and intuitions and unconsciously
reasoned conclusions of genius sometimes assume
similar illusions. Socrates, Luther, Swedenborg,
Blake saw visions and heard voices just as
Saint Francis and Saint Joan did. If Newton’s
imagination had been of the same vividly dramatic
kind he might have seen the ghost of Pythagoras
walk into the orchard and explain why the apples
were falling. Such an illusion would have invalidated
neither the theory of gravitation nor Newton’s
general sanity. What is more, the visionary method
of making the discovery would not be a whit more
miraculous than the normal method. The test of
sanity is not the normality of the method but the
reasonableness of the discovery. If Newton had
been informed by Pythagoras that the moon was
made of green cheese, then Newton would have been
locked up. Gravitation, being a reasoned hypothesis
which fitted remarkably well into the Copernican
version of the observed physical facts of the universe,
established Newton’s reputation for extraordinary
intelligence, and would have done so no matter
how fantastically he had arrived at it. Yet his
theory of gravitation is not so impressive a mental
feat as his astounding chronology, which establishes
him as the king of mental conjurors, but a Bedlamite
king whose authority no one now accepts. On the
subject of the eleventh horn of the beast seen by the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xix">xix</span>prophet Daniel he was more fantastic than Joan,
because his imagination was not dramatic but mathematical
and therefore extraordinarily susceptible to
numbers: indeed if all his works were lost except his
chronology we should say that he was as mad as a
hatter. As it is, who dares diagnose Newton as a
madman?</p>

<p class="c011">In the same way Joan must be judged a sane
woman in spite of her voices because they never gave
her any advice that might not have come to her from
her mother wit exactly as gravitation came to Newton.
We can all see now, especially since the late war
threw so many of our women into military life, that
Joan’s campaigning could not have been carried on
in petticoats. This was not only because she did a
man’s work, but because it was morally necessary that
sex should be left out of the question as between her
and her comrades-in-arms. She gave this reason herself
when she was pressed on the subject; and the fact
that this entirely reasonable necessity came to her
imagination first as an order from God delivered
through the mouth of Saint Catherine does not prove
that she was mad. The soundness of the order
proves that she was unusually sane; but its form
proves that her dramatic imagination played tricks
with her senses. Her policy was also quite sound:
nobody disputes that the relief of Orleans, followed
up by the coronation at Rheims of the Dauphin as a
counterblow to the suspicions then current of his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xx">xx</span>legitimacy and consequently of his title, were military
and political masterstrokes that saved France.
They might have been planned by Napoleon or any
other illusionproof genius. They came to Joan as
an instruction from her Counsel, as she called her
visionary saints; but she was none the less an able
leader of men for imagining her ideas in this way.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c8">The Evolutionary Appetite.</h3>

<p class="c010">What then is the modern view of Joan’s voices
and visions and messages from God? The nineteenth
century said that they were delusions, but that as
she was a pretty girl, and had been abominably ill-treated
and finally done to death by a superstitious
rabble of medieval priests hounded on by a corrupt
political bishop, it must be assumed that she was the
innocent dupe of these delusions. The twentieth century
finds this explanation too vapidly commonplace,
and demands something more mystic. I think the
twentieth century is right, because an explanation
which amounts to Joan being mentally defective instead
of, as she obviously was, mentally excessive,
will not wash. I cannot believe, nor, if I could,
could I expect all my readers to believe, as Joan did,
that three ocularly visible well dressed persons, named
respectively Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and
Saint Michael, came down from heaven and gave her
certain instructions with which they were charged
by God for her. Not that such a belief would be
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>more improbable or fantastic than some modern beliefs
which we all swallow; but there are fashions
and family habits in belief, and it happens that, my
fashion being Victorian and my family habit Protestant,
I find myself unable to attach any such objective
validity to the form of Joan’s visions.</p>

<p class="c011">But that there are forces at work which use individuals
for purposes far transcending the purpose
of keeping these individuals alive and prosperous
and respectable and safe and happy in the middle
station in life, which is all any good bourgeois can
reasonably require, is established by the fact that
men will, in the pursuit of knowledge and of social
readjustments for which they will not be a penny the
better, and are indeed often many pence the worse,
face poverty, infamy, exile, imprisonment, dreadful
hardship, and death. Even the selfish pursuit of personal
power does not nerve men to the efforts and
sacrifices which are eagerly made in pursuit of extensions
of our power over nature, though these extensions
may not touch the personal life of the seeker
at any point. There is no more mystery about this
appetite for knowledge and power than about the
appetite for food: both are known as facts and as
facts only, the difference between them being that
the appetite for food is necessary to the life of the
hungry man and is therefore a personal appetite,
whereas the other is an appetite for evolution, and
therefore a superpersonal need.</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="pageno" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>The diverse manners in which our imaginations
dramatize the approach of the superpersonal forces
is a problem for the psychologist, not for the historian.
Only, the historian must understand that visionaries
are neither impostors nor lunatics. It is
one thing to say that the figure Joan recognized as
St Catherine was not really St Catherine, but the
dramatization by Joan’s imagination of that pressure
upon her of the driving force that is behind evolution
which I have just called the evolutionary appetite.
It is quite another to class her visions with the
vision of two moons seen by a drunken person, or
with Brocken spectres, echoes and the like. Saint
Catherine’s instructions were far too cogent for that;
and the simplest French peasant who believes in apparitions
of celestial personages to favored mortals
is nearer to the scientific truth about Joan than the
Rationalist and Materialist historians and essayists
who feel obliged to set down a girl who saw saints
and heard them talking to her as either crazy or
mendacious. If Joan was mad, all Christendom was
mad too; for people who believe devoutly in the existence
of celestial personages are every whit as mad
in that sense as the people who think they see them.
Luther, when he threw his inkhorn at the devil, was
no more mad than any other Augustinian monk: he
had a more vivid imagination, and had perhaps eaten
and slept less: that was all.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
  <h3 class="c009" id="c9">The mere Iconography does not matter.</h3>
</div>

<p class="c010">All the popular religions in the world are made
apprehensible by an array of legendary personages,
with an Almighty Father, and sometimes a mother
and divine child, as the central figures. These are
presented to the mind’s eye in childhood; and the
result is a hallucination which persists strongly
throughout life when it has been well impressed.
Thus all the thinking of the hallucinated adult about
the fountain of inspiration which is continually flowing
in the universe, or about the promptings of virtue
and the revulsions of shame: in short, about aspiration
and conscience, both of which forces are matters
of fact more obvious than electro-magnetism, is
thinking in terms of the celestial vision. And when
in the case of exceptionally imaginative persons,
especially those practising certain appropriate austerities,
the hallucination extends from the mind’s
eye to the body’s, the visionary sees Krishna or the
Buddha or the Blessed Virgin or St Catherine as
the case may be.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c10">The Modern Education which Joan escaped.</h3>

<p class="c010">It is important to everyone nowadays to understand
this, because modern science is making short
work of the hallucinations without regard to the
vital importance of the things they symbolize. If
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span>Joan were reborn today she would be sent, first to a
convent school in which she would be mildly taught
to connect inspiration and conscience with St Catherine
and St Michael exactly as she was in the fifteenth
century, and then finished up with a very
energetic training in the gospel of Saints Louis
Pasteur and Paul Bert, who would tell her (possibly
in visions but more probably in pamphlets) not to
be a superstitious little fool, and to empty out St
Catherine and the rest of the Catholic hagiology as
an obsolete iconography of exploded myths. It
would be rubbed into her that Galileo was a martyr,
and his persecutors incorrigible ignoramuses, and
that St Teresa’s hormones had gone astray and left
her incurably hyperpituitary or hyperadrenal or
hysteroid or epileptoid or anything but asteroid.
She would have been convinced by precept and experiment
that baptism and receiving the body of her
Lord were contemptible superstitions, and that vaccination
and vivisection were enlightened practices.
Behind her new Saints Louis and Paul there would
be not only Science purifying Religion and being
purified by it, but hypochondria, melancholia, cowardice,
stupidity, cruelty, muckraking curiosity,
knowledge without wisdom, and everything that
the eternal soul in Nature loathes, instead of the
virtues of which St Catherine was the figure head.
As to the new rites, which would be the saner Joan?
the one who carried little children to be baptized of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>water and the spirit, or the one who sent the police
to force their parents to have the most villainous
racial poison we know thrust into their veins? the
one who told them the story of the angel and
Mary, or the one who questioned them as to their
experiences of the Edipus complex? the one to
whom the consecrated wafer was the very body of
the virtue that was her salvation, or the one who
looked forward to a precise and convenient regulation
of her health and her desires by a nicely calculated
diet of thyroid extract, adrenalin, thymin, pituitrin,
and insulin, with pick-me-ups of hormone stimulants,
the blood being first carefully fortified with antibodies
against all possible infections by inoculations
of infected bacteria and serum from infected animals,
and against old age by surgical extirpation of the
reproductive ducts or weekly doses of monkey gland?</p>

<p class="c011">It is true that behind all these quackeries there is
a certain body of genuine scientific physiology. But
was there any the less a certain body of genuine
psychology behind St Catherine and the Holy Ghost?
And which is the healthier mind? the saintly mind or
the monkey gland mind? Does not the present cry
of Back to the Middle Ages, which has been incubating
ever since the pre-Raphaelite movement began,
mean that it is no longer our Academy pictures that
are intolerable, but our credulities that have not the
excuse of being superstitions, our cruelties that have
not the excuse of barbarism, our persecutions that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>have not the excuse of religious faith, our shameless
substitution of successful swindlers and scoundrels
and quacks for saints as objects of worship, and our
deafness and blindness to the calls and visions of the
inexorable power that made us, and will destroy us if
we disregard it? To Joan and her contemporaries
we should appear as a drove of Gadarene swine, possessed
by all the unclean spirits cast out by the faith
and civilization of the Middle Ages, running violently
down a steep place into a hell of high explosives.
For us to set up our condition as a standard
of sanity, and declare Joan mad because she never
condescended to it, is to prove that we are not only
lost but irredeemable. Let us then once for all drop
all nonsense about Joan being cracked, and accept
her as at least as sane as Florence Nightingale, who
also combined a very simple iconography of religious
belief with a mind so exceptionally powerful that it
kept her in continual trouble with the medical and
military panjandrums of her time.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c11">Failures of the Voices.</h3>

<p class="c010">That the voices and visions were illusory, and their
wisdom all Joan’s own, is shewn by the occasions on
which they failed her, notably during her trial, when
they assured her that she would be rescued. Here her
hopes flattered her; but they were not unreasonable:
her military colleague La Hire was in command of a
considerable force not so very far off; and if the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</span>Armagnacs, as her party was called, had really
wanted to rescue her, and had put anything like her
own vigor into the enterprise, they could have attempted
it with very fair chances of success. She
did not understand that they were glad to be rid
of her, nor that the rescue of a prisoner from the
hands of the Church was a much more serious business
for a medieval captain, or even a medieval king,
than its mere physical difficulty as a military exploit
suggested. According to her lights her expectation
of a rescue was reasonable; therefore she heard
Madame Saint Catherine assuring her it would happen,
that being her way of finding out and making up
her own mind. When it became evident that she
had miscalculated: when she was led to the stake, and
La Hire was not thundering at the gates of Rouen
nor charging Warwick’s men at arms, she threw over
Saint Catherine at once, and recanted. Nothing
could be more sane or practical. It was not until
she discovered that she had gained nothing by her
recantation but close imprisonment for life that she
withdrew it, and deliberately and explicitly chose
burning instead: a decision which shewed not only
the extraordinary decision of her character, but also
a Rationalism carried to its ultimate human tests of
suicide. Yet even in this the illusion persisted; and
she announced her relapse as dictated to her by her
voices.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span>
  <h3 class="c009" id="c12">Joan a Galtonic Visualizer.</h3>
</div>

<p class="c010">The most sceptical scientific reader may therefore
accept as a flat fact, carrying no implication of unsoundness
of mind, that Joan was what Francis Galton
and other modern investigators of human faculty
call a visualizer. She saw imaginary saints just as
some other people see imaginary diagrams and landscapes
with numbers dotted about them, and are
thereby able to perform feats of memory and arithmetic
impossible to non-visualizers. Visualizers will
understand this at once. Non-visualizers who
have never read Galton will be puzzled and incredulous.
But a very little inquiry among their acquaintances
will reveal to them that the mind’s eye is
more or less a magic lantern, and that the street is
full of normally sane people who have hallucinations
of all sorts which they believe to be part of the
normal permanent equipment of all human beings.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c13">Joan’s Manliness and Militarism.</h3>

<p class="c010">Joan’s other abnormality, too common among uncommon
things to be properly called a peculiarity,
was her craze for soldiering and the masculine life.
Her father tried to frighten her out of it by threatening
to drown her if she ran away with the soldiers,
and ordering her brothers to drown her if he were
not on the spot. This extravagance was clearly not
serious: it must have been addressed to a child young
enough to imagine that he was in earnest. Joan
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxix">xxix</span>must therefore as a child have wanted to run away
and be a soldier. The awful prospect of being
thrown into the Meuse and drowned by a terrible
father and her big brothers kept her quiet until
the father had lost his terrors and the brothers
yielded to her natural leadership; and by that time
she had sense enough to know that the masculine and
military life was not a mere matter of running away
from home. But the taste for it never left her, and
was fundamental in determining her career.</p>

<p class="c011">If anyone doubts this, let him ask himself why a
maid charged with a special mission from heaven to
the Dauphin (this was how Joan saw her very able
plan for retrieving the desperate situation of the
uncrowned king) should not have simply gone to the
court as a maid, in woman’s dress, and urged her
counsel upon him in a woman’s way, as other women
with similar missions had come to his mad father
and his wise grandfather. Why did she insist on
having a soldier’s dress and arms and sword and
horse and equipment, and on treating her escort of
soldiers as comrades, sleeping side by side with them
on the floor at night as if there were no difference
of sex between them? It may be answered that this
was the safest way of travelling through a country
infested with hostile troops and bands of marauding
deserters from both sides. Such an answer has no
weight, because it applies to all the women who travelled
in France at that time, and who never dreamt
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span>of travelling otherwise than as women. But even
if we accept it, how does it account for the fact that
when the danger was over, and she could present
herself at court in feminine attire with perfect safety
and obviously with greater propriety, she presented
herself in her man’s dress, and instead of urging
Charles, like Queen Victoria urging the War Office
to send Roberts to the Tranvaal, to send D’Alençon,
De Rais, La Hire and the rest to the relief of Dunois
at Orleans, insisted that she must go herself and
lead the assault in person? Why did she give exhibitions
of her dexterity in handling a lance, and
of her seat as a rider? Why did she accept presents
of armor and chargers and masculine surcoats, and
in every action repudiate the conventional character
of a woman? The simple answer to all these questions
is that she was the sort of woman that wants
to lead a man’s life. They are to be found <a id="tn-wherever"/>wherever
there are armies on foot or navies on the seas,
serving in male disguise, eluding detection for astonishingly
long periods, and sometimes, no doubt, escaping
it entirely. When they are in a position to
defy public opinion they throw off all concealment.
You have your Rosa Bonheur painting in male
blouse and trousers, and George Sand living a man’s
life and almost compelling her Chopins and De Mussets
to live women’s lives to amuse her. Had Joan
not been one of those “unwomanly women,” she
might have been canonized much sooner.</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>But it is not necessary to wear trousers and smoke
big cigars to live a man’s life any more than it is
necessary to wear petticoats to live a woman’s. There
are plenty of gowned and bodiced women in ordinary
civil life who manage their own affairs and other
people’s, including those of their menfolk, and are
entirely masculine in their tastes and pursuits. There
always were such women, even in the Victorian days
when women had fewer legal rights than men, and
our modern women magistrates, mayors, and members
of Parliament were unknown. In reactionary
Russia in our own century a woman soldier organized
an effective regiment of amazons, which disappeared
only because it was Aldershottian enough to
be against the Revolution. The exemption of women
from military service is founded, not on any natural
inaptitude that men do not share, but on the fact
that communities cannot reproduce themselves without
plenty of women. Men are more largely dispensable,
and are sacrificed accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c14">Was Joan Suicidal.</h3>

<p class="c010">These two abnormalities were the only ones that
were irresistibly prepotent in Joan; and they brought
her to the stake. Neither of them was peculiar to
her. There was nothing peculiar about her except
the vigor and scope of her mind and character, and
the intensity of her vital energy. She was accused
of a suicidal tendency; and it is a fact that when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span>she attempted to escape from Beaurevoir Castle by
jumping from a tower said to be sixty feet high,
she took a risk beyond reason, though she recovered
from the crash after a few days fasting. Her death
was deliberately chosen as an alternative to life
without liberty. In battle she challenged death as
Wellington did at Waterloo, and as Nelson habitually
did when he walked his quarter deck during his
battles with all his decorations in full blaze. As
neither Nelson nor Wellington nor any of those who
have performed desperate feats, and preferred death
to captivity, have been accused of suicidal mania,
Joan need not be suspected of it. In the Beaurevoir
affair there was more at stake than her freedom. She
was distracted by the news that Compiègne was about
to fall; and she was convinced that she could save
it if only she could get free. Still, the leap was so
perilous that her conscience was not quite easy about
it; and she expressed this, as usual, by saying that
Saint Catherine had forbidden her to do it, but forgave
her afterwards for her disobedience.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c15">Joan Summed Up.</h3>

<p class="c010">We may accept and admire Joan, then, as a sane
and shrewd country girl of extraordinary strength
of mind and hardihood of body. Everything she
did was thoroughly calculated; and though the process
was so rapid that she was hardly conscious of it,
and ascribed it all to her voices, she was a woman of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span>policy and not of blind impulse. In war she was as
much a realist as Napoleon: she had his eye for artillery
and his knowledge of what it could do. She did
not expect besieged cities to fall Jerichowise at the
sound of her trumpet, but, like Wellington, adapted
her methods of attack to the peculiarities of the defence;
and she anticipated the Napoleonic calculation
that if you only hold on long enough the other fellow
will give in: for example, her final triumph at Orleans
was achieved after her commander Dunois had
sounded the retreat at the end of a day’s fighting
without a decision. She was never for a moment
what so many romancers and playwrights have pretended:
a romantic young lady. She was a thorough
daughter of the soil in her peasantlike matter-of-factness
and doggedness, and her acceptance of great
lords and kings and prelates as such without idolatry
or snobbery, seeing at a glance how much they were
individually good for. She had the respectable countrywoman’s
sense of the value of public decency, and
would not tolerate foul language and neglect of
religious observances, nor allow disreputable women
to hang about her soldiers. She had one pious ejaculation
“<i><span lang="fr">En nom Dé!</span></i>” and one meaningless oath “<i><span lang="fr">Par
mon martin</span></i>”; and this much swearing she allowed
to the incorrigibly blasphemous La Hire equally
with herself. The value of this prudery was so great
in restoring the self-respect of the badly demoralized
army that, like most of her policy, it justified itself
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</span>as soundly calculated. She talked to and dealt with
people of all classes, from laborers to kings, without
embarrassment or affectation, and got them to do
what she wanted when they were not afraid or corrupt.
She could coax and she could hustle, her
tongue having a soft side and a sharp edge. She was
very capable: a born boss.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c16">Joan’s Immaturity and Ignorance.</h3>

<p class="c010">All this, however, must be taken with one heavy
qualification. She was only a girl in her teens. If
we could think of her as a managing woman of fifty
we should seize her type at once; for we have plenty
of managing women among us of that age who illustrate
perfectly the sort of person she would have
become had she lived. But she, being only a lass
when all is said, lacked their knowledge of men’s
vanities and of the weight and proportion of social
forces. She knew nothing of iron hands in velvet
gloves: she just used her fists. She thought political
changes much easier than they are, and, like Mahomet
in his innocence of any world but the tribal
world, wrote letters to kings calling on them to make
millennial rearrangements. Consequently it was only
in the enterprises that were really simple and compassable
by swift physical force, like the coronation
and the Orleans campaign, that she was successful.</p>

<p class="c011">Her want of academic education disabled her when
she had to deal with such elaborately artificial structures
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</span>as the great ecclesiastical and social institutions
of the Middle Ages. She had a horror of heretics
without suspecting that she was herself a heresiarch,
one of the precursors of a schism that rent Europe
in two, and cost centuries of bloodshed that is not yet
staunched. She objected to foreigners on the sensible
ground that they were not in their proper place
in France; but she had no notion of how this
brought her into conflict with Catholicism and Feudalism,
both essentially international. She worked
by commonsense; and where scholarship was the only
clue to institutions she was in the dark and broke
her shins against them, all the more rudely because
of her enormous self-confidence, which made her the
least cautious of human beings in civil affairs.</p>

<p class="c011">This combination of inept youth and academic ignorance
with great natural capacity, push, courage,
devotion, originality and oddity, fully accounts for
all the facts in Joan’s career, and makes her a credible
historical and human phenomenon; but it clashes
most discordantly both with the idolatrous romance
that has grown up round her, and the belittling scepticism
that reacts against that romance.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c17">The Maid in Literature.</h3>

<p class="c010">English readers would probably like to know how
these idolizations and reactions have affected the
books they are most familiar with about Joan. There
is the first part of the Shakesperean, or pseudo-Shakesperean
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</span>trilogy of Henry VI, in which Joan
is one of the leading characters. This portrait of
Joan is not more authentic than the descriptions in
the London papers of George Washington in 1780,
of Napoleon in 1803, of the German Crown Prince
in 1917, or of Lenin in 1917. It ends in mere scurrility.
The impression left by it is that the playwright,
having begun by an attempt to make Joan
a beautiful and romantic figure, was told by his
scandalized company that English patriotism would
never stand a sympathetic representation of a French
conqueror of English troops, and that unless he at
once introduced all the old charges against Joan of
being a sorceress and a harlot, and assumed her to be
guilty of all of them, his play could not be produced.
As likely as not, this is what actually happened:
indeed there is only one other apparent way of accounting
for the sympathetic representation of Joan
as a heroine culminating in her eloquent appeal to the
Duke of Burgundy, followed by the blackguardly
scurrility of the concluding scenes. That other way
is to assume that the original play was wholly scurrilous,
and that Shakespear touched up the earlier
scenes. As the work belongs to a period at which
he was only beginning his practice as a tinker of old
works, before his own style was fully formed and
hardened, it is impossible to verify this guess. His
finger is not unmistakably evident in the play, which
is poor and base in its moral tone; but he may have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</span>tried to redeem it from downright infamy by shedding
a momentary glamor on the figure of The Maid.</p>

<p class="c011">When we jump over two centuries to Schiller, we
find Die Jungfrau von Orleans drowned in a witch’s
caldron of raging romance. Schiller’s Joan has not
a single point of contact with the real Joan, nor
indeed with any mortal woman that ever walked this
earth. There is really nothing to be said of his play
but that it is not about Joan at all, and can hardly
be said to pretend to be; for he makes her die on
the battlefield, finding her burning unbearable. Before
Schiller came Voltaire, who burlesqued Homer
in a mock epic called La Pucelle. It is the fashion
to dismiss this with virtuous indignation as an obscene
libel; and I certainly cannot defend it against
the charge of extravagant indecorum. But its purpose
was not to depict Joan, but to kill with ridicule
everything that Voltaire righteously hated in
the institutions and fashions of his own day. He
made Joan ridiculous, but not contemptible nor (comparatively)
unchaste; and as he also made Homer
and St Peter and St Denis and the brave Dunois
ridiculous, and the other heroines of the poem very
unchaste indeed, he may be said to have let Joan
off very easily. But indeed the personal adventures
of the characters are so outrageous, and so Homerically
free from any pretence at or even possibility
of historical veracity, that those who affect to take
them seriously only make themselves Pecksniffian.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</span>Samuel Butler believed The Iliad to be a burlesque
of Greek Jingoism and Greek religion, written by a
hostage or a slave; and La Pucelle makes Butler’s
theory almost convincing. Voltaire represents Agnes
Sorel, the Dauphin’s mistress, whom Joan never met,
as a woman with a consuming passion for the chastest
concubinal fidelity, whose fate it was to be continually
falling into the hands of licentious foes and suffering
the worst extremities of rapine. The combats
in which Joan rides a flying donkey, or in which,
taken unaware with no clothes on, she defends Agnes
with her sword, and inflicts appropriate mutilations
on her assailants, can be laughed at as they are intended
to be without scruple; for no sane person
could mistake them for sober history; and it may be
that their ribald irreverence is more wholesome than
the beglamored sentimentality of Schiller. Certainly
Voltaire should not have asserted that Joan’s father
was a priest; but when he was out to <i><span lang="fr">écraser l’infâme</span></i>
(the French Church) he stuck at nothing.</p>

<p class="c011">So far, the literary representations of The Maid
were legendary. But the publication by Quicherat
in 1841 of the reports of her trial and rehabilitation
placed the subject on a new footing. These entirely
realistic documents created a living interest in Joan
which Voltaire’s mock Homerics and Schiller’s romantic
nonsense missed. Typical products of that
interest in America and England are the histories of
Joan by Mark Twain and Andrew Lang. Mark
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span>Twain was converted to downright worship of Joan
directly by Quicherat. Later on, another man of
Genius, Anatole France, reacted against the Quicheratic
wave of enthusiasm, and wrote a Life of Joan in
which he attributed Joan’s ideas to clerical prompting
and her military success to an adroit use of her
by Dunois as a <i><span lang="fr">mascotte</span></i>: in short, he denied that
she had any serious military or political ability. At
this Andrew saw red, and went for Anatole’s scalp
in a rival Life of her which should be read as a corrective
to the other. Lang had no difficulty in shewing
that Joan’s ability was not an unnatural fiction
to be explained away as an illusion manufactured by
priests and soldiers, but a straightforward fact.</p>

<p class="c011">It has been lightly pleaded in explanation that
Anatole France is a Parisian of the art world, into
whose scheme of things the able, hardheaded, hardhanded
female, though she dominates provincial
France and business Paris, does not enter; whereas
Lang was a Scot, and every Scot knows that the grey
mare is as likely as not to be the better horse. But
this explanation does not convince me. I cannot
believe that Anatole France does not know what
everybody knows. I wish everybody knew all that
he knows. One feels antipathies at work in his book.
He is not anti-Joan; but he is anti-clerical, anti-mystic,
and fundamentally unable to believe that
there ever was any such person as the real Joan.</p>

<p class="c011">Mark Twain’s Joan, skirted to the ground, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xl">xl</span>with as many petticoats as Noah’s wife in a toy ark,
is an attempt to combine Bayard with Esther Summerson
from Bleak House into an unimpeachable
American school teacher in armor. Like Esther
Summerson she makes her creator ridiculous, and
yet, being the work of a man of genius, remains a
credible human goodygoody in spite of her creator’s
infatuation. It is the description rather than the
valuation that is wrong. Andrew Lang and Mark
Twain are equally determined to make Joan a beautiful
and most ladylike Victorian; but both of them
recognize and insist on her capacity for leadership,
though the Scots scholar is less romantic about it
than the Mississippi pilot. But then Lang was, by
lifelong professional habit, a critic of biographies
rather than a biographer, whereas Mark Twain
writes his biography frankly in the form of a romance.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c18">Protestant Misunderstandings of the Middle Ages.</h3>

<p class="c010">They had, however, one disability in common. To
understand Joan’s history it is not enough to understand
her character: you must understand her environment
as well. Joan in a nineteenth-twentieth
century environment is as incongruous a figure as
she would appear were she to walk down Piccadilly
today in her fifteenth century armor. To see her
in her proper perspective you must understand
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xli">xli</span>Christendom and the Catholic Church, the Holy Roman
Empire and the Feudal System, as they existed
and were understood in the Middle Ages. If you
confuse the Middle Ages with the Dark Ages, and
are in the habit of ridiculing your aunt for wearing
“medieval clothes,” meaning those in vogue in
the eighteen-nineties, and are quite convinced that
the world has progressed enormously, both morally
and mechanically, since Joan’s time, then you will
never understand why Joan was burnt, much less feel
that you might have voted for burning her yourself
if you had been a member of the court that tried
her; and until you feel that you know nothing essential
about her.</p>

<p class="c011">That the Mississippi pilot should have broken
down on this misunderstanding is natural enough.
Mark Twain, the Innocent Abroad, who saw the
lovely churches of the Middle Ages without a throb
of emotion, author of A Yankee at the Court of
King Arthur, in which the heroes and heroines of
medieval chivalry are guys seen through the eyes
of a street arab, was clearly out of court from the
beginning. Andrew Lang was better read; but, like
Walter Scott, he enjoyed medieval history as a
string of border romances rather than as the record
of a high European civilization based on a catholic
faith. Both of them were baptized as Protestants,
and impressed by all their schooling and most of
their reading with the belief that Catholic bishops
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span>who burnt heretics were persecutors capable of any
villainy; that all heretics were Albigensians or Husites
or Jews or Protestants of the highest character;
and that the Inquisition was a Chamber of Horrors
invented expressly and exclusively for such burnings.
Accordingly we find them representing Peter
Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, the judge who sent
Joan to the stake, as an unconscionable scoundrel,
and all the questions put to her as “traps” to ensnare
and destroy her. And they assume unhesitatingly
that the two or three score of canons and
doctors of law and divinity who sat with Cauchon as
assessors, were exact reproductions of him on slightly
less elevated chairs and with a different headdress.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c19">Comparative Fairness of Joan’s Trial.</h3>

<p class="c010">The truth is that Cauchon was threatened and insulted
by the English for being too considerate to
Joan. A recent French writer denies that Joan was
burnt, and holds that Cauchon spirited her away and
burnt somebody or something else in her place,
and that the pretender who subsequently personated
her at Orleans and elsewhere was not a pretender
but the real authentic Joan. He is able to
cite Cauchon’s pro-Joan partiality in support of
his view. As to the assessors, the objection to
them is not that they were a row of uniform
rascals, but that they were political partisans of
Joan’s enemies. This is a valid objection to all
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xliii">xliii</span>such trials; but in the absence of neutral tribunals
they are unavoidable. A trial by Joan’s French
partisans would have been as unfair as the
trial by her French opponents; and an equally
mixed tribunal would have produced a deadlock. Such
recent trials as those of Edith Cavell by a German
tribunal and Roger Casement by an English one
were open to the same objection; but they went forward
to the death nevertheless, because neutral tribunals
were not available. Edith, like Joan, was an
arch heretic: in the middle of the war she declared
before the world that “Patriotism is not enough.”
She nursed enemies back to health, and assisted their
prisoners to escape, making it abundantly clear that
she would help any fugitive or distressed person
without asking whose side he was on, and acknowledging
no distinction before Christ between Tommy
and Jerry and Pitou the <i><span lang="fr">poilu</span></i>. Well might Edith
have wished that she could bring the Middle Ages
back, and have fifty civilians learned in the law or
vowed to the service of God, to support two skilled
judges in trying her case according to the Catholic
law of Christendom, and to argue it out with her
at sitting after sitting for many weeks. The modern
military Inquisition was not so squeamish. It
shot her out of hand; and her countrymen, seeing in
this a good opportunity for lecturing the enemy on
his intolerance, put up a statue to her, but took
particular care not to inscribe on the pedestal “Patriotism
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xliv">xliv</span>is not enough,” for which omission, and the
lie it implies, they will need Edith’s intercession when
they are themselves brought to judgment, if any
heavenly power thinks such moral cowards capable
of pleading to an intelligible indictment.</p>

<p class="c011">The point need be no further labored. Joan was
persecuted essentially as she would be persecuted today.
The change from burning to hanging or
shooting may strike us as a change for the better.
The change from careful trial under ordinary law
to recklessly summary military terrorism may strike
us as a change for the worse. But as far as toleration
is concerned the trial and execution in Rouen in 1431
might have been an event of today; and we may
charge our consciences accordingly. If Joan had to
be dealt with by us in London she would be treated
with no more toleration than Miss Silvia Pankhurst,
or the Peculiar People, or the parents who keep their
children from the elementary school, or any of the
others who cross the line we have to draw, rightly
or wrongly, between the tolerable and the intolerable.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c20">Joan not tried as a Political Offender.</h3>

<p class="c010">Besides, Joan’s trial was not, like Casement’s, a
national political trial. Ecclesiastical courts and the
courts of the Inquisition (Joan was tried by a combination
of the two) were Courts Christian: that is,
international courts; and she was tried, not as a
traitress, but as a heretic, blasphemer, sorceress and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xlv">xlv</span>idolater. Her alleged offences were not political offences
against England, nor against the Burgundian
faction in France, but against God and against the
common morality of Christendom. And although the
idea we call Nationalism was so foreign to the medieval
conception of Christian society that it might
almost have been directly charged against Joan as
an additional heresy, yet it was not so charged; and
it is unreasonable to suppose that the political bias
of a body of Frenchmen like the assessors would on
this point have run strongly in favor of the English
foreigners (even if they had been making themselves
particularly agreeable in France instead of just the
contrary) against a Frenchwoman who had vanquished
them.</p>

<p class="c011">The tragic part of the trial was that Joan, like
most prisoners tried for anything but the simplest
breaches of the ten commandments, did not understand
what they were accusing her of. She was much
more like Mark Twain than like Peter Cauchon.
Her attachment to the Church was very different
from the Bishop’s, and does not, in fact, bear close
examination from his point of view. She delighted in
the solaces the Church offers to sensitive souls: to
her, confession and communion were luxuries beside
which the vulgar pleasures of the senses were trash.
Her prayers were wonderful conversations with her
three saints. Her piety seemed superhuman to the
formally dutiful people whose religion was only a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</span>task to them. But when the Church was not offering
her her favorite luxuries, but calling on her to
accept its interpretation of God’s will, and to sacrifice
her own, she flatly refused, and made it clear
that her notion of a Catholic Church was one in
which the Pope was Pope Joan. How could the
Church tolerate that, when it had just destroyed
Hus, and had watched the career of Wycliffe with
a growing anger that would have brought him, too,
to the stake, had he not died a natural death before
the wrath fell on him in his grave? Neither Hus nor
Wycliffe was as bluntly defiant as Joan: both were
reformers of the Church like Luther; whilst Joan,
<a id="tn-mrs"/>like Mrs Eddy, was quite prepared to supersede St
Peter as the rock on which the Church was built, and,
like Mahomet, was always ready with a private revelation
from God to settle every question and fit <a id="tn-every"/>every
occasion.</p>

<p class="c011">The enormity of Joan’s pretension was proved by
her own unconsciousness of it, which we call her innocence,
and her friends called her simplicity. Her solutions
of the problems presented to her seemed, and
indeed mostly were, the plainest commonsense, and
their revelation to her by her Voices was to her a
simple matter of fact. How could plain commonsense
and simple fact seem to her to be that hideous
thing, heresy? When rival prophetesses came into
the field, she was down on them at once for liars and
humbugs; but she never thought of them as heretics.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</span>She was in a state of invincible ignorance as to the
Church’s view; and the Church could not tolerate
her pretensions without either waiving its authority
or giving her a place beside the Trinity during her
lifetime and in her teens, which was unthinkable.
Thus an irresistible force met an immovable obstacle,
and developed the heat that consumed poor Joan.</p>

<p class="c011">Mark and Andrew would have shared her innocence
and her fate had they been dealt with by the
Inquisition: that is why their accounts of the trial
are as absurd as hers might have been could she have
written one. All that can be said for their assumption
that Cauchon was a vulgar villain, and that the
questions put to Joan were traps, is that it has the
support of the inquiry which rehabilitated her
<span class="nonstandard">twentyfive</span> years later. But this rehabilitation was
as corrupt as the contrary proceeding applied to
Cromwell by our Restoration reactionaries. Cauchon
had been dug up, and his body thrown into the common
sewer. Nothing was easier than to accuse him
of cozenage, and declare the whole trial void on that
account. That was what everybody wanted, from
Charles the Victorious, whose credit was bound up
with The Maid’s, to the patriotic Nationalist populace,
who idolized Joan’s memory. The English were
gone; and a verdict in their favor would have been
an outrage on the throne and on the patriotism which
Joan had set on foot.</p>

<p class="c011">We have none of these overwhelming motives of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</span>political convenience and popularity to bias us. For
us the first trial stands valid; and the rehabilitation
would be negligible but for the mass of sincere testimony
it produced as to Joan’s engaging personal
character. The question then arises: how did The
Church get over the verdict at the first trial when
it canonized Joan five hundred years later?</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c21">The Church uncompromised by its Amends.</h3>

<p class="c010">Easily enough. In the Catholic Church, far more
than in law, there is no wrong without a remedy. It
does not defer to Joanesque private judgment as
such, the supremacy of private judgment for the
individual being the quintessence of Protestantism;
nevertheless it finds a place for private judgment
<i><span lang="la">in excelsis</span></i> by admitting that the highest wisdom may
come as a divine revelation to an individual. On
sufficient evidence it will declare that individual a
saint. Thus, as revelation may come by way of an
enlightenment of the private judgment no less than
by words of a celestial personage appearing in a
vision, a saint may be defined as a person of heroic
virtue whose private judgment is privileged. Many
innovating saints, notably Francis and Clare, have
been in conflict with the Church during their lives,
and have thus raised the question whether they were
heretics or saints. Francis might have gone to the
stake had he lived longer. It is therefore by no
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xlix">xlix</span>means impossible for a person to be excommunicated
as a heretic, and on further consideration canonized
as a saint. Excommunication by a provincial
ecclesiastical court is not one of the acts for which
the Church claims infallibility. Perhaps I had better
inform my Protestant readers that the famous
Dogma of Papal Infallibility is by far the most
modest pretension of the kind in existence. Compared
to our infallible democracies, our infallible
medical councils, our infallible astronomers, our infallible
judges, and our infallible parliaments, the
Pope is on his knees in the dust confessing his ignorance
before the throne of God, asking only that as
to certain historical matters on which he has clearly
more sources of information open to him than anyone
else his decision shall be taken as final. The
Church may, and perhaps some day will, canonize
Galileo without compromising such infallibility as it
claims for the Pope, if not without compromising
the infallibility claimed for the Book of Joshua by
simple souls whose rational faith in more important
things has become bound up with a quite irrational
faith in the chronicle of Joshua’s campaigns as a
treatise on physics. Therefore the Church will probably
not canonize Galileo yet awhile, though it might
do worse. But it has been able to canonize Joan
without any compromise at all. She never doubted
that the sun went round the earth: she had seen it
do so too often.</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="pageno" id="Page_l">l</span>Still, there was a great wrong done to Joan and
to the conscience of the world by her burning. <i><span lang="fr">Tout
comprendre, c’est tout pardonner</span></i>, which is the Devil’s
sentimentality, cannot excuse it. When we have
admitted that the tribunal was not only honest and
legal, but exceptionally merciful in respect of sparing
Joan the torture which was customary when she
was obdurate as to taking the oath, and that Cauchon
was far more self-disciplined and conscientious
both as priest and lawyer than any English judge
ever dreams of being in a political case in which his
party and class prejudices are involved, the human
fact remains that the burning of Joan of Arc was a
horror, and that a historian who would defend it
would defend anything. The final criticism of its
physical side is implied in the refusal of the Marquesas
islanders to be persuaded that the English did
not eat Joan. Why, they ask, should anyone take
the trouble to roast a human being except with that
object? They cannot conceive its being a pleasure.
As we have no answer for them that is not shameful
to us, let us blush for our more complicated and
pretentious savagery before we proceed to unravel
the business further, and see what other lessons it
contains for us.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c22">Cruelty, Modern and Medieval.</h3>

<p class="c010">First, let us get rid of the notion that the mere
physical cruelty of the burning has any special significance.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_li">li</span>Joan was burnt just as dozens of less
interesting heretics were burnt in her time. Christ,
in being crucified, only shared the fate of thousands
of forgotten malefactors. They have no pre-eminence
in mere physical pain: much more horrible
executions than theirs are on record, to say nothing
of the agonies of so-called natural death at its
worst.</p>

<p class="c011">Joan was burnt more than five hundred years ago.
More than three hundred years later: that is, only
about a hundred years before I was born, a woman
was burnt on Stephen’s Green in my native city of
Dublin for coining, which was held to be treason.
In my preface to the recent volume on English
Prisons under Local Government, by Sidney and
Beatrice Webb, I have mentioned that when I was
already a grown man I saw Richard Wagner conduct
two concerts, and that when Richard Wagner was a
young man he saw and avoided a crowd of people
hastening to see a soldier broken on the wheel by the
more cruel of the two ways of carrying out that
hideous method of execution. Also that the penalty
of hanging, drawing and quartering, unmentionable
in its details, was abolished so recently that there are
men living who have been sentenced to it. We are
still flogging criminals, and clamoring for more flogging.
Not even the most sensationally frightful of
these atrocities inflicted on its victim the misery,
degradation, and conscious waste and loss of life suffered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lii">lii</span>in our modern prisons, especially the model
ones, without, as far as I can see, rousing any more
compunction than the burning of heretics did in the
Middle Ages. We have not even the excuse of getting
some fun out of our prisons as the Middle Ages
did out of their stakes and wheels and gibbets. Joan
herself judged this matter when she had to choose
between imprisonment and the stake, and chose the
stake. And thereby she deprived The Church of the
plea that it was guiltless of her death, which was the
work of the secular arm. The Church should have
confined itself to excommunicating her. There it was
within its rights: she had refused to accept its
authority or comply with its conditions; and it could
say with truth “You are not one of us: go forth and
find the religion that suits you, or found one for
yourself.” It had no right to say “You may return
to us now that you have recanted; but you shall stay
in a dungeon all the rest of your life.” Unfortunately,
The Church did not believe that there was
any genuine soul saving religion outside itself; and it
was deeply corrupted, as all the churches were and
still are, by primitive Calibanism (in Browning’s
sense), or the propitiation of a dreaded deity by
suffering and sacrifice. Its method was not cruelty
for cruelty’s sake, but cruelty for the salvation of
Joan’s soul. Joan, however, believed that the saving
of her soul was her own business, and not that of
<i><span lang="fr">les gens d’église</span></i>. By using that term as she did,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_liii">liii</span>mistrustfully and contemptuously, she announced
herself as, in germ, an anti-Clerical as thoroughgoing
as Voltaire or Anatole France. Had she said in
so many words “To the dustbin with the Church
Militant and its blackcoated officials: I recognize
only the Church Triumphant in heaven,” she would
hardly have put her view more plainly.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c23">Catholic Anti-Clericalism.</h3>

<p class="c010">I must not leave it to be inferred here that one
cannot be an anti-Clerical and a good Catholic too.
All the reforming Popes have been vehement anti-Clericals,
veritable scourges of the clergy. All the
great Orders arose from dissatisfaction with the
priests: that of the Franciscans with priestly snobbery,
that of the Dominicans with priestly laziness
and Laodiceanism, that of the Jesuits with priestly
apathy and ignorance and indiscipline. The most
bigoted Ulster Orangeman or Leicester Low Church
bourgeois (as described by Mr Henry Nevinson) is
a mere Gallio compared to Machiavelli, who, though
no Protestant, was a fierce anti-Clerical. Any
Catholic may, and many Catholics do, denounce any
priest or body of priests, as lazy, drunken, idle, dissolute,
and unworthy of their great Church and their
function as the pastors of their flocks of human souls.
But to say that the souls of the people are no business
of the Churchmen is to go a step further, a step
across the Rubicon. Joan virtually took that step.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_liv">liv</span>
  <h3 class="c009" id="c24">Catholicism not yet Catholic Enough.</h3>
</div>

<p class="c010">And so, if we admit, as we must, that the burning
of Joan was a mistake, we must broaden Catholicism
sufficiently to include her in its charter. Our
Churches must admit that no official organization of
mortal men whose vocation does not carry with it
extraordinary mental powers (and this is all that any
Church Militant can in the face of fact and history
pretend to be), can keep pace with the private judgment
of persons of genius except when, by a very rare
accident, the genius happens to be Pope, and not
even then unless he is an exceedingly overbearing
Pope. The Churches must learn humility as well as
teach it. The Apostolic Succession cannot be secured
or confined by the laying on of hands: the tongues
of fire have descended on heathens and outcasts too
often for that, leaving anointed Churchmen to scandalize
History as worldly rascals. When the Church
Militant behaves as if it were already the Church
Triumphant, it makes these appalling blunders about
Joan and Bruno and Galileo and the rest which make
it so difficult for a Freethinker to join it; and a
Church which has no place for Freethinkers: nay,
which does not inculcate and encourage freethinking
with a complete belief that thought, when really
free, must by its own law take the path that leads to
The Church’s bosom, not only has no future in
modern culture, but obviously has no faith in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lv">lv</span>valid science of its own tenets, and is guilty of the
heresy that theology and science are two different
and opposite impulses, rivals for human allegiance.</p>

<p class="c011">I have before me the letter of a Catholic priest.
“In your play,” he writes, “I see the dramatic
presentation of the conflict of the Regal, sacerdotal,
and Prophetical powers, in which Joan was crushed.
To me it is not the victory of any one of them over
the others that will bring peace and the Reign of the
Saints in the Kingdom of God, but their fruitful
interaction in a costly but noble state of tension.”
The Pope himself could not put it better; nor can I.
We must accept the tension, and maintain it nobly
without letting ourselves be tempted to relieve it by
burning the thread. This is Joan’s lesson to The
Church; and its formulation by the hand of a priest
emboldens me to claim that her canonization was a
magnificently Catholic gesture as the canonization of
a Protestant saint by the Church of Rome. But its
special value and virtue cannot be apparent until it
is known and understood as such. If any simple
priest for whom this is too hard a saying tells me
that it was not so intended, I shall remind him that
the Church is in the hands of God, and not, as simple
priests imagine, God in the hands of the Church; so
if he answers too confidently for God’s intentions he
may be asked “Hast thou entered into the springs
of the sea? or hast thou walked in the recesses of the
deep?” And Joan’s own answer is also the answer
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lvi">lvi</span>of old: “Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him;
<em>but I will maintain my own ways before Him</em>.”</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c25">The Law of Change is the Law of God.</h3>

<p class="c010">When Joan maintained her own ways she claimed,
like Job, that there was not only God and the Church
to be considered, but the Word made Flesh: that is,
the unaveraged individual, representing life possibly
at its highest actual human evolution and possibly at
its lowest, but never at its merely mathematical average.
Now there is no deification of the democratic
average in the theory of the Church: it is an avowed
hierarchy in which the members are sifted until at the
end of the process an individual stands supreme as
the Vicar of Christ. But when the process is examined
it appears that its successive steps of selection
and election are of the superior by the inferior (the
cardinal vice of democracy), with the result that
great popes are as rare and accidental as great
kings, and that it has sometimes been safer for an
aspirant to the Chair and the Keys to pass as a moribund
dotard than as an energetic saint. At best
very few popes have been canonized, or could be
without letting down the standard of sanctity set by
the self-elected saints.</p>

<p class="c011">No other result could have been reasonably expected;
for it is not possible that an official organization
of the spiritual needs of millions of men and
women, mostly poor and ignorant, should compete
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lvii">lvii</span>successfully in the selection of its principals with the
direct choice of the Holy Ghost as it flashes with
unerring aim upon the individual. Nor can any
College of Cardinals pray effectively that its choice
may be inspired. The conscious prayer of the inferior
may be that his choice may light on a greater
than himself; but the sub-conscious intention of his
self-preserving individuality must be to find a trustworthy
servant for his own purposes. The saints
and prophets, though they may be accidentally in
this or that official position or rank, are always
really self-selected, like Joan. And since neither
Church nor State, by the secular necessities of its
constitution, can guarantee even the recognition of
such self-chosen missions, there is nothing for us but
to make it a point of honor to privilege heresy to
the last bearable degree on the simple ground that
all evolution in thought and conduct must at first
appear as heresy and misconduct. In short, though
all society is founded on intolerance, all improvement
is founded on tolerance, or the recognition of
the fact that the law of evolution is Ibsen’s law of
change. And as the law of God, in any sense of the
word which can now command a faith proof against
science is a law of evolution, it follows that the law
of God is a law of change, and that when the
Churches set themselves against change as such, they
are setting themselves against the law of God.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_lviii">lviii</span>
  <h3 class="c009" id="c26">Credulity, Modern and Medieval.</h3>
</div>

<p class="c010">When Abernethy, the famous doctor, was asked
why he indulged himself with all the habits he warned
his patients against as unhealthy, he replied that his
business was that of a direction post, which points
out the way to a place, but does not go thither itself.
He might have added that neither does it compel the
traveller to go thither, nor prevent him from seeking
some other way. Unfortunately our clerical direction
posts always do coerce the traveller when they
have the political power to do so. When the Church
was a temporal as well as a spiritual power, and for
long after to the full extent to which it could control
or influence the temporal power, it enforced
conformity by persecutions that were all the more
ruthless because their intention was so excellent.
Today, when the doctor has succeeded to the priest,
and can do practically what he likes with parliament
and the press through the blind faith in him which
has succeeded to the far more critical faith in the
parson, legal compulsion to take the doctor’s prescription,
however poisonous, is carried to an extent
that would have horrified the Inquisition and staggered
Archbishop Laud. Our credulity is grosser
than that of the Middle Ages, because the priest had
no such direct pecuniary interest in our sins as the
doctor has in our diseases: he did not starve when
all was well with his flock, nor prosper when they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lix">lix</span>were perishing, as our private commercial doctors
must. Also the medieval cleric believed that something
extremely unpleasant would happen to him
after death if he was unscrupulous, a belief now
practically extinct among persons receiving a dogmatically
materialist education. Our professional
corporations are Trade Unions without souls to be
damned! and they will soon drive us to remind them
that they have bodies to be kicked. The Vatican
was never soulless: at worst it was a political conspiracy
to make the Church supreme temporally as
well as spiritually. Therefore the question raised by
Joan’s burning is a burning question still, though
the penalties involved are not so sensational. That
is why I am probing it. If it were only an historical
curiosity I would not waste my reader’s time and my
own on it for five minutes.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c27">Toleration, Modern and Medieval.</h3>

<p class="c010">The more closely we grapple with it the more
difficult it becomes. At first sight we are disposed
to repeat that Joan should have been excommunicated
and then left to go her own way, though she
would have protested vehemently against so cruel a
deprivation of her spiritual food; for confession,
absolution, and the body of her Lord were first
necessities of life to her. Such a spirit as Joan’s
might have got over that difficulty as the Church of
England got over the Bulls of Pope Leo, by making
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lx">lx</span>a Church of her own, and affirming it to be the temple
of the true and original faith from which her persecutors
had strayed. But as such a proceeding was,
in the eyes of both Church and State at that time, a
spreading of damnation and anarchy, its toleration
involved a greater strain on faith in freedom than
political and ecclesiastical human nature could bear.
It is easy to say that the Church should have waited
for the alleged evil results instead of assuming that
they would occur, and what they would be. That
sounds simple enough; but if a modern Public Health
Authority were to leave people entirely to their own
devices in the matter of sanitation, saying, “We have
nothing to do with drainage or your views about
drainage; but if you catch smallpox or typhus we
will prosecute you and have you punished very
severely like the authorities in Butler’s Erewhon,” it
would either be removed to the County Asylum or
reminded that A’s neglect of sanitation may kill the
child of B two miles off, or start an epidemic in which
the most conscientious sanitarians may perish.</p>

<p class="c011">We must face the fact that society is founded on
intolerance. There are glaring cases of the abuse
of intolerance; but they are quite as characteristic
of our own age as of the Middle Ages. The typical
modern example and contrast is compulsory inoculation
replacing what was virtually compulsory baptism.
But compulsion to inoculate is objected to as
a crudely unscientific and mischievous anti-sanitary
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxi">lxi</span>quackery, not in the least because we think it wrong
to compel people to protect their children from
disease. Its opponents would make it a crime, and
will probably succeed in doing so; and that will be
just as intolerant as making it compulsory. Neither
the Pasteurians nor their opponents the Sanitarians
would leave parents free to bring up their children
naked, though that course also has some plausible
advocates. We may prate of toleration as we will;
but society must always draw a line somewhere between
allowable conduct and insanity or crime, in
spite of the risk of mistaking sages for lunatics and
saviors for blasphemers. We must persecute, even
to the death; and all we can do to mitigate the danger
of persecution is, first, to be very careful what we
persecute, and second, to bear in mind that unless
there is a large liberty to shock conventional people,
and a well informed sense of the value of originality,
individuality, and eccentricity, the result will be
apparent stagnation covering a repression of evolutionary
forces which will eventually explode with
extravagant and probably destructive violence.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c28">Variability of Toleration.</h3>

<p class="c010">The degree of tolerance attainable at any moment
depends on the strain under which society is maintaining
its cohesion. In war, for instance, we suppress
the gospels and put Quakers in prison, muzzle
the newspapers, and make it a serious offence to shew
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxii">lxii</span>a light at night. Under the strain of invasion the
French Government in 1792 struck off 4000 heads,
mostly on grounds that would not in time of settled
peace have provoked any Government to chloroform
a dog; and in 1920 the British Government slaughtered
and burnt in Ireland to persecute the advocates
of a constitutional change which it had presently to
effect itself. Later on the Fascisti in Italy did
everything that the Black and Tans did in Ireland,
with some grotesquely ferocious variations, under
the strain of an unskilled attempt at industrial revolution
by Socialists who understood Socialism even
less than Capitalists understand Capitalism. In the
United States an incredibly savage persecution of
Russians took place during the scare spread by the
Russian Bolshevik revolution after 1917. These
instances could easily be multiplied; but they are
enough to shew that between a maximum of indulgent
toleration and a ruthlessly intolerant Terrorism
there is a scale through which toleration is continually
rising or falling, and that there was not the
smallest ground for the self-complacent conviction
of the nineteenth century that it was more tolerant
than the fifteenth, or that such an event as the execution
of Joan could not possibly occur in what we call
our own more enlightened times. Thousands of
women, each of them a thousand times less dangerous
and terrifying to our Governments than Joan was to
the Government of her day, have within the last ten
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxiii">lxiii</span>years been slaughtered, starved to death, burnt out
of house and home, and what not that Persecution and
Terror could do to them, in the course of Crusades
far more tyrannically pretentious than the medieval
Crusades which proposed nothing more hyperbolical
than the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre from the
Saracens. The Inquisition, with its English equivalent
the Star Chamber, are gone in the sense that
their names are now disused; but can any of the
modern substitutes for the Inquisition, the Special
Tribunals and Commissions, the punitive expeditions,
the suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act, the proclamations
of martial law and of minor states of siege,
and the rest of them, claim that their victims have
as fair a trial, as well considered a body of law to
govern their cases, or as conscientious a judge to
insist on strict legality of procedure as Joan had
from the Inquisition and from the spirit of the
Middle Ages even when her country was under the
heaviest strain of civil and foreign war? From us
she would have had no trial and no law except a
Defence of The Realm Act suspending all law; and
for judge she would have had, at best, a bothered
major, and at worst a promoted advocate in ermine
and scarlet to whom the scruples of a trained ecclesiastic
like Cauchon would seem ridiculous and
ungentlemanly.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_lxiv">lxiv</span>
  <h3 class="c009" id="c29">The Conflict between Genius and Discipline.</h3>
</div>

<p class="c010">Having thus brought the matter home to ourselves,
we may now consider the special feature of
Joan’s mental constitution which made her so unmanageable.
What is to be done on the one hand
with rulers who will not give any reason for their
orders, and on the other with people who cannot
understand the reasons when they are given? The
government of the world, political, industrial, and
domestic, has to be carried on mostly by the giving
and obeying of orders under just these conditions.
<a id="tn-dont"/>“<span class="nonstandard">Dont</span> argue: do as you are told” has to be said
not only to children and soldiers, but practically to
everybody. Fortunately most people do not want
to argue: they are only too glad to be saved the
trouble of thinking for themselves. And the ablest
and most independent thinkers are content to understand
their own special department. In other departments
they will unhesitatingly ask for and accept
the instructions of a policeman or the advice of a
tailor without demanding or desiring explanations.</p>

<p class="c011">Nevertheless, there must be some ground for
attaching authority to an order. A child will obey
its parents, a soldier his officer, a philosopher a railway
porter, and a workman a foreman, all without
question, because it is generally accepted that those
who give the orders understand what they are about,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxv">lxv</span>and are duly authorized and even obliged to give
them, and because, in the practical emergencies of
daily life, there is no time for lessons and explanations,
or for arguments as to their validity. Such
obediences are as necessary to the continuous operation
of our social system as the revolutions of the
earth are to the succession of night and day. But
they are not so spontaneous as they seem: they have
to be very carefully arranged and maintained. A
bishop will defer to and obey a king; but let a curate
venture to give him an order, however necessary and
sensible, and the bishop will forget his cloth and
damn the curate’s impudence. The more obedient
a man is to accredited authority the more jealous he
is of allowing any unauthorized person to order him
about.</p>

<p class="c011">With all this in mind, consider the career of Joan.
She was a village girl, in authority over sheep and
pigs, dogs and chickens, and to some extent over her
father’s hired laborers when he hired any, but over
no one else on earth. Outside the farm she had no
authority, no prestige, no claim to the smallest deference.
Yet she ordered everybody about, from her
uncle to the king, the archbishop, and the military
General Staff. Her uncle obeyed her like a sheep,
and took her to the castle of the local commander,
who, on being ordered about, tried to assert himself,
but soon collapsed and obeyed. And so on up to the
king, as we have seen. This would have been unbearably
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxvi">lxvi</span>irritating even if her orders had been offered
as rational solutions of the desperate difficulties in
which her social superiors found themselves just then.
But they were not so offered. Nor were they offered
as the expression of Joan’s arbitrary will. It was
never “I say so,” but always “God says so.”</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c30">Joan as Theocrat.</h3>

<p class="c010">Leaders who take that line have no trouble with
some people, and no end of trouble with others.
They need never fear a lukewarm reception. Either
they are messengers of God, or they are blasphemous
impostors. In the Middle Ages the general belief
in witchcraft greatly intensified this contrast, because
when an apparent miracle happened (as in the
case of the wind changing at Orleans) it proved the
divine mission to the credulous, and proved a contract
with the devil to the sceptical. All through, Joan
had to depend on those who accepted her as an incarnate
angel against those who added to an intense
resentment of her presumption a bigoted abhorrence
of her as a witch. To this abhorrence we must add
the extreme irritation of those who did not believe
in the voices, and regarded her as a liar and impostor.
It is hard to conceive anything more
infuriating to a statesman or a military commander,
or to a court favorite, than to be overruled at every
turn, or to be robbed of the ear of the reigning
sovereign, by an impudent young upstart practising
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxvii">lxvii</span>on the credulity of the populace and the vanity and
silliness of an immature prince by exploiting a few
of those lucky coincidences which pass as miracles
with uncritical people. Not only were the envy,
snobbery, and competitive ambition of the baser
natures exacerbated by Joan’s success, but among
the friendly ones that were clever enough to be
critical a quite reasonable scepticism and mistrust of
her ability, founded on a fair observation of her
obvious ignorance and temerity, were at work against
her. And as she met all remonstrances and all criticisms,
not with arguments or persuasion, but with a
flat appeal to the authority of God and a claim to
be in God’s special confidence, she must have seemed,
to all who were not infatuated by her, so insufferable
that nothing but an unbroken chain of overwhelming
successes in the military and political field could have
saved her from the wrath that finally destroyed her.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c31">Unbroken Success essential in Theocracy.</h3>

<p class="c010">To forge such a chain she needed to be the King,
the Archbishop of Rheims, the Bastard of Orleans,
and herself into the bargain; and that was impossible.
From the moment when she failed to stimulate
Charles to follow up his coronation with a swoop on
Paris she was lost. The fact that she insisted on this
whilst the king and the rest timidly and foolishly
thought they could square the Duke of Burgundy,
and effect a combination with him against the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxviii">lxviii</span>English, made her a terrifying nuisance to them;
and from that time onward she could do nothing but
prowl about the battlefields waiting for some lucky
chance to sweep the captains into a big move. But
it was to the enemy that the chance came: she was
taken prisoner by the Burgundians fighting before
Compiègne, and at once discovered that she had not
a friend in the political world. Had she escaped she
would probably have fought on until the English
were gone, and then had to shake the dust of the
court off her feet, and retire to Domrémy as Garibaldi
had to retire to Caprera.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c32">Modern Distortions of Joan’s History.</h3>

<p class="c010">This, I think, is all that we can now pretend to
say about the prose of Joan’s career. The romance
of her rise, the tragedy of her execution, and the
comedy of the attempts of posterity to make amends
for that execution, belong to my play and not to my
preface, which must be confined to a sober essay on
the facts. That such an essay is badly needed can be
ascertained by examining any of our standard works
of reference. They give accurately enough the
facts about the visit to Vaucouleurs, the annunciation
to Charles at Chinon, the raising of the siege of
Orleans and the subsequent battles, the coronation
at Rheims, the capture at Compiègne, and the trial
and execution at Rouen, with their dates and the
names of the people concerned; but they all break
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxix">lxix</span>down on the melodramatic legend of the wicked
bishop and the entrapped maiden and the rest of it.
It would be far less misleading if they were wrong
as to the facts, and right in their view of the facts.
As it is, they illustrate the too little considered truth
that the fashion in which we think changes like the
fashion of our clothes, and that it is difficult, if not
impossible, for most people to think otherwise than
in the fashion of their own period.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c33">History always out of Date.</h3>

<p class="c010">This, by the way, is why children are never taught
contemporary history. Their history books deal with
periods of which the thinking has passed out of
fashion, and the circumstances no longer apply to
active life. For example, they are taught history
about Washington, and told lies about Lenin. In
Washington’s time they were told lies (the same lies)
about Washington, and taught history about Cromwell.
In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries they
were told lies about Joan, and by this time might
very well be told the truth about her. Unfortunately
the lies did not cease when the political circumstances
became obsolete. The Reformation, which Joan had
unconsciously anticipated, kept the questions which
arose in her case burning up to our own day (you
can see plenty of the burnt houses still in Ireland),
with the result that Joan has remained the subject
of anti-Clerical lies, of specifically Protestant lies,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxx">lxx</span>and of Roman Catholic evasions of her unconscious
Protestantism. The truth sticks in our throats with
all the sauces it is served with: it will never go down
until we take it without any sauce at all.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c34">The Real Joan not Marvellous Enough for Us.</h3>

<p class="c010">But even in its simplicity, the faith demanded by
Joan is one which the anti-metaphysical temper of
nineteenth century civilization, which remains powerful
in England and America, and is tyrannical in
France, contemptuously refuses her. We do not,
like her contemporaries, rush to the opposite extreme
in a recoil from her as from a witch self-sold to the
devil, because we do not believe in the devil nor in
the possibility of commercial contracts with him.
Our credulity, though enormous, is not boundless;
and our stock of it is quite used up by our mediums,
clairvoyants, hand readers, slate writers, Christian
Scientists, psycho-analysts, electronic vibration
diviners, therapeutists of all schools registered and
unregistered, astrologers, astronomers who tell us
that the sun is nearly a hundred million miles away
and that Betelgeuse is ten times as big as the whole
universe, physicists who balance Betelgeuse by
describing the incredible smallness of the atom, and
a host of other marvel mongers whose credulity would
have dissolved the Middle Ages in a roar of sceptical
merriment. In the Middle Ages people believed that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxi">lxxi</span>the earth was flat, for which they had at least the
evidence of their senses: we believe it to be round,
not because as many as one per cent of us could give
the physical reasons for so quaint a belief, but because
modern science has convinced us that nothing
that is obvious is true, and that everything that is
magical, improbable, extraordinary, gigantic, microscopic,
heartless, or outrageous is scientific.</p>

<p class="c011">I must not, by the way, be taken as implying that
the earth is flat, or that all or any of our amazing
credulities are delusions or impostures. I am only
defending my own age against the charge of being
less imaginative than the Middle Ages. I affirm that
the nineteenth century, and still more the twentieth,
can knock the fifteenth into a cocked hat in point of
susceptibility to marvels and miracles and saints and
prophets and magicians and monsters and fairy tales
of all kinds. The proportion of marvel to immediately
credible statement in the latest edition of the
Encyclopædia Britannica is enormously greater than
in the Bible. The medieval doctors of divinity who
did not pretend to settle how many angels could
dance on the point of a needle cut a very poor figure
as far as romantic credulity is concerned beside the
modern physicists who have settled to the billionth of
a millimetre every movement and position in the
dance of the electrons. Not for worlds would I
question the precise accuracy of these calculations or
the existence of electrons (whatever they may be).
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxii">lxxii</span>The fate of Joan is a warning to me against such
heresy. But why the men who believe in electrons
should regard themselves as less credulous than the
men who believed in angels is not apparent to me.
If they refuse to believe, with the Rouen assessors of
1431, that Joan was a witch, it is not because that
explanation is too marvellous, but because it is not
marvellous enough.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c35">The Stage Limits of Historical Representation.</h3>

<p class="c010">For the story of Joan I refer the reader to the
play which follows. It contains all that need be
known about her; but as it is for stage use I have
had to condense into three and a half hours a series
of events which in their historical happening were
spread over four times as many months; for the
theatre imposes unities of time and place from which
Nature in her boundless wastefulness is free. Therefore
the reader must not suppose that Joan really
put Robert de Baudricourt in her pocket in fifteen
minutes, nor that her excommunication, recantation,
relapse, and death at the stake were a matter of half
an hour or so. Neither do I claim more for my
dramatizations of Joan’s contemporaries than that
some of them are probably slightly more like the
originals than those imaginary portraits of all the
Popes from Saint Peter onward through the Dark
Ages which are still gravely exhibited in the Uffizi
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxiii">lxxiii</span>in Florence (or were when I was there last). My
Dunois would do equally well for the Duc d’Alençon.
Both left descriptions of Joan so similar that, as a
man always describes himself unconsciously whenever
he describes anyone else, I have inferred that these
goodnatured young men were very like one another
in mind; so I have lumped the twain into a single
figure, thereby saving the theatre manager a salary
and a suit of armor. Dunois’ face, still on record at
Châteaudun, is a suggestive help. But I really know
no more about these men and their circle than
Shakespear knew about Falconbridge and the Duke
of Austria, or about Macbeth and Macduff. In view
of the things they did in history, and have to do
again in the play, I can only invent appropriate
characters for them in Shakespear’s manner.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c36">A Void in the Elizabethan Drama.</h3>

<p class="c010">I have, however, one advantage over the Elizabethans.
I write in full view of the Middle Ages,
which may be said to have been rediscovered in the
middle of the nineteenth century after an eclipse of
about four hundred and fifty years. The Renascence
of antique literature and art in the sixteenth
century, and the lusty growth of Capitalism, between
them buried the Middle Ages; and their resurrection
is a second Renascence. Now there is not a breath
of medieval atmosphere in Shakespear’s histories.
His John of Gaunt is like a study of the old age of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxiv">lxxiv</span>Drake. Although he was a Catholic by family tradition,
his figures are all intensely Protestant, individualist,
sceptical, self-centered in everything but
their love affairs, and completely personal and selfish
even in them. His kings are not statesmen: his cardinals
have no religion: a novice can read his plays
from one end to the other without learning that the
world is finally governed by forces expressing themselves
in religions and laws which make epochs rather
than by vulgarly ambitious individuals who make
rows. The divinity which shapes our ends, rough
hew them how we will, is mentioned fatalistically only
to be forgotten immediately like a passing vague
apprehension. To Shakespear as to Mark Twain,
Cauchon would have been a tyrant and a bully
instead of a Catholic, and the inquisitor Lemaître
would have been a Sadist instead of a lawyer. Warwick
would have had no more feudal quality than his
successor the King Maker has in the play of Henry
VI. We should have seen them all completely satisfied
that if they would only to their own selves be
true they could not then be false to any man (a
precept which represents the reaction against medievalism
at its intensest) as if they were beings in the
air, without public responsibilities of any kind. All
Shakespear’s characters are so: that is why they seem
natural to our middle classes, who are comfortable
and irresponsible at other people’s expense, and are
neither ashamed of that condition nor even conscious
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxv">lxxv</span>of it. Nature abhors this vacuum in Shakespear;
and I have taken care to let the medieval atmosphere
blow through my play freely. Those who see it performed
will not mistake the startling event it records
for a mere personal accident. They will have before
them not only the visible and human puppets, but
the Church, the Inquisition, the Feudal System, with
divine inspiration always beating against their too
inelastic limits: all more terrible in their dramatic
force than any of the little mortal figures clanking
about in plate armor or moving silently in the frocks
and hoods of the order of St Dominic.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c37">Tragedy not Melodrama.</h3>

<p class="c010">There are no villains in the piece. Crime, like
disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done
away with by general consent, and that is all about
it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions,
and what normal men and women find that
they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that
really concern us. The rascally bishop and the cruel
inquisitor of Mark Twain and Andrew Lang are as
dull as pickpockets; and they reduce Joan to the
level of the even less interesting person whose pocket
is picked. I have represented both of them as capable
and eloquent exponents of The Church Militant and
The Church Litigant, because only by doing so can
I maintain my drama on the level of high tragedy
and save it from becoming a mere police court sensation.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxvi">lxxvi</span>A villain in a play can never be anything more
than a <i><span lang="la">diabolus ex machina</span></i>, possibly a more exciting
expedient than a <i><span lang="la">deus ex machina</span></i>, but both equally
mechanical, and therefore interesting only as mechanism.
It is, I repeat, what normally innocent people
do that concerns us; and if Joan had not been burnt
by normally innocent people in the energy of their
righteousness her death at their hands would have no
more significance than the Tokyo earthquake, which
burnt a great many maidens. The tragedy of such
murders is that they are not committed by murderers.
They are judicial murders, pious murders; and
this contradiction at once brings an element of
comedy into the tragedy: the angels may weep at the
murder, but the gods laugh at the murderers.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c38">The Inevitable Flatteries of Tragedy.</h3>

<p class="c010">Here then we have a reason why my drama of
Saint Joan’s career, though it may give the essential
truth of it, gives an inexact picture of some accidental
facts. It goes almost without saying that the
old Jeanne d’Arc melodramas, reducing everything
to a conflict of villain and hero, or in Joan’s case
villain and heroine, not only miss the point entirely,
but falsify the characters, making Cauchon a scoundrel,
Joan a prima donna, and Dunois a lover. But
the writer of high tragedy and comedy, aiming at
the innermost attainable truth, must needs flatter
Cauchon nearly as much as the melodramatist vilifies
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxvii">lxxvii</span>him. Although there is, as far as I have been
able to discover, nothing against Cauchon that convicts
him of bad faith or exceptional severity in his
judicial relations with Joan, or of as much anti-prisoner,
pro-police, class and sectarian bias as we
now take for granted in our own courts, yet there is
hardly more warrant for classing him as a great
Catholic churchman, completely proof against the
passions roused by the temporal situation. Neither
does the inquisitor Lemaître, in such scanty accounts
of him as are now recoverable, appear quite so able
a master of his duties and of the case before him as
I have given him credit for being. But it is the business
of the stage to make its figures more intelligible
to themselves than they would be in real life; for by
no other means can they be made intelligible to the
audience. And in this case Cauchon and Lemaître
have to make intelligible not only themselves but the
Church and the Inquisition, just as Warwick has to
make the feudal system intelligible, the three between
them having thus to make a twentieth century
audience conscious of an epoch fundamentally different
from its own. Obviously the real Cauchon,
Lemaître, and Warwick could not have done this:
they were part of the Middle Ages themselves, and
therefore as unconscious of its peculiarities as of the
atomic formula of the air they breathed. But the
play would be unintelligible if I had not endowed
them with enough of this consciousness to enable
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxviii">lxxviii</span>them to explain their attitude to the twentieth century.
All I claim is that by this inevitable sacrifice
of verisimilitude I have secured in the only possible
way sufficient veracity to justify me in claiming that
as far as I can gather from the available documentation,
and from such powers of divination as I possess,
the things I represent these three exponents of the
drama as saying are the things they actually would
have said if they had known what they were really
doing. And beyond this neither drama nor history
can go in my hands.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c39">Some well-meant Proposals for the Improvement of the Play.</h3>

<p class="c010">I have to thank several critics on both sides of the
Atlantic, including some whose admiration for my
play is most generously enthusiastic, for their heartfelt
instructions as to how it can be improved. They
point out that by the excision of the epilogue and all
the references to such undramatic and tedious matters
as the Church, the feudal system, the Inquisition,
the theory of heresy and so forth, all of which, they
point out, would be ruthlessly blue pencilled by any
experienced manager, the play could be considerably
shortened. I think they are mistaken. The experienced
knights of the blue pencil, having saved an
hour and a half by disembowelling the play, would
at once proceed to waste two hours in building
elaborate scenery, having real water in the river
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxix">lxxix</span>Loire and a real bridge across it, and staging an
obviously sham fight for possession of it, with the
victorious French led by Joan on a real horse. The
coronation would eclipse all previous theatrical displays,
shewing, first, the procession through the
streets of Rheims, and then the service in the cathedral,
with special music written for both. Joan
would be burnt on the stage, as Mr Matheson Lang
always is in The Wandering Jew, on the principle
that it does not matter in the least why a woman is
burnt provided she is burnt, and people can pay to
see it done. The intervals between the acts whilst
these splendors were being built up and then demolished
by the stage carpenters would seem eternal, to
the great profit of the refreshment bars. And the
weary and demoralized audience would lose their last
trains and curse me for writing such inordinately
long and intolerably dreary and meaningless plays.
But the applause of the press would be unanimous.
Nobody who knows the stage history of Shakespear
will doubt that this is what would happen if I knew
my business so little as to listen to these well intentioned
but disastrous counsellors: indeed it probably
will happen when I am no longer in control of the
performing rights. So perhaps it will be as well for
the public to see the play while I am still alive.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxx">lxxx</span>
  <h3 class="c009" id="c40">The Epilogue.</h3>
</div>

<p class="c010">As to the epilogue, I could hardly be expected to
stultify myself by implying that Joan’s history in
the world ended unhappily with her execution, instead
of beginning there. It was necessary by hook
or crook to shew the canonized Joan as well as the
incinerated one; for many a woman has got herself
burnt by carelessly whisking a muslin skirt into the
drawing room fireplace, but getting canonized is a
different matter, and a more important one. So I
am afraid the epilogue must stand.</p>

<h3 class="c009" id="c41">To the Critics, lest they should feel Ignored.</h3>

<p class="c010">To a professional critic (I have been one myself)
theatre-going is the curse of Adam. The play is the
evil he is paid to endure in the sweat of his brow;
and the sooner it is over, the better. This would
seem to place him in irreconcilable opposition to the
paying playgoer, from whose point of view the
longer the play, the more entertainment he gets for
his money. It does in fact so place him, especially
in the provinces, where the playgoer goes to the
theatre for the sake of the play solely, and insists
so effectively on a certain number of hours’ entertainment
that touring managers are sometimes seriously
embarrassed by the brevity of the London plays they
have to deal in.</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxxi">lxxxi</span>For in London the critics are reinforced by a
considerable body of persons who go to the theatre
as many others go to church, to display their best
clothes and compare them with other people’s; to be
in the fashion, and have something to talk about at
dinner parties; to adore a pet performer; to pass
the evening anywhere rather than at home: in short,
for any or every reason except interest in dramatic
art as such. In fashionable centres the number of
irreligious people who go to church, of unmusical
people who go to concerts and operas, and of
undramatic people who go to the theatre, is so
prodigious that sermons have been cut down to ten
minutes and plays to two hours; and, even at that,
congregations sit longing for the benediction and
audiences for the final curtain, so that they may get
away to the lunch or supper they really crave for,
after arriving as late as (or later than) the hour of
beginning can possibly be made for them.</p>

<p class="c011">Thus from the stalls and in the Press an atmosphere
of hypocrisy spreads. Nobody says straight
out that genuine drama is a tedious nuisance, and
that to ask people to endure more than two hours
of it (with two long intervals of relief) is an intolerable
imposition. Nobody says “I hate classical
tragedy and comedy as I hate sermons and symphonies;
but I like police news and divorce news and
any kind of dancing or decoration that has an
aphrodisiac effect on me or on my wife or husband.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxxii">lxxxii</span>And whatever superior people may pretend, I cannot
associate pleasure with any sort of intellectual
activity; and I <span class="nonstandard">dont</span> believe anyone else can either.”
Such things are not said; yet nine-tenths of what is
offered as criticism of the drama in the metropolitan
Press of Europe and America is nothing but a
muddled paraphrase of it. If it does not mean that,
it means nothing.</p>

<p class="c011">I do not complain of this, though it complains
very unreasonably of me. But I can take no more
notice of it than Einstein of the people who are incapable
of mathematics. I write in the classical
manner for those who pay for admission to a theatre
because they like classical comedy or tragedy for its
own sake, and like it so much when it is good of its
kind and well done that they tear themselves away
from it with reluctance to catch the very latest train
or omnibus that will take them home. Far from
arriving late from an eight or half-past eight o’clock
dinner so as to escape at least the first half-hour of
the performance, they stand in queues outside the
theatre doors for hours beforehand in bitingly cold
weather to secure a seat. In countries where a play
lasts a week, they bring baskets of provisions and sit
it out. These are the patrons on whom I depend for
my bread. I do not give them performances twelve
hours long, because circumstances do not at present
make such entertainments feasible; though a performance
beginning after breakfast and ending at
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxxiii">lxxxiii</span>sunset is as possible physically and artistically in
Surrey or Middlesex as in Ober-Ammergau; and an
all-night sitting in a theatre would be at least as
enjoyable as an all-night sitting in the House of
Commons, and much more useful. But in St Joan
I have done my best by going to the well-established
classical limit of three and a half hours practically
continuous playing, barring the one interval imposed
by considerations which have nothing to do with art.
I know that this is hard on the pseudo-critics and on
the fashionable people whose playing is a hypocrisy.
I cannot help feeling some compassion for them when
they assure me that my play, though a great play,
must fail hopelessly, because it does not begin at a
quarter to nine and end at eleven. The facts are
overwhelmingly against them. They forget that all
men are not as they are. Still, I am sorry for them;
and though I cannot for their sakes undo my work
and help the people who hate the theatre to drive
out the people who love it, yet I may point out to
them that they have several remedies in their own
hands. They can escape the first part of the play
by their usual practice of arriving late. They can
escape the epilogue by not waiting for it. And if
the irreducible minimum thus attained is still too
painful, they can stay away altogether. But I
deprecate this extreme course, because it is good
neither for my pocket nor for their own souls.
Already a few of them, noticing that what matters
<span class="pageno" id="Page_lxxxiv">lxxxiv</span>is not the absolute length of time occupied by a play,
but the speed with which that time passes, are discovering
that the theatre, though purgatorial in its
Aristotelian moments, is not necessarily always the
dull place they have so often found it. What do its
discomforts matter when the play makes us forget
them?</p>

<p class="c018">A fine spring morning on the river Meuse, between
Lorraine and Champagne, in the year 1429 <span class="fss">A.D.</span>,
in the castle of Vaucouleurs.</p>

</div>

<div class="sd-out">

<p class="c011">Captain Robert de Baudricourt, a military squire,
handsome and physically energetic, but with no will of
his own, is disguising that defect in his usual fashion
by storming terribly at his steward, a trodden worm,
scanty of flesh, scanty of hair, who might be any age
from 18 to 55, being the sort of man whom age cannot
wither because he has never bloomed.</p>

</div>

<div class="sd-out">

<p class="c011">The two are in a sunny stone chamber on the first
floor of the castle. At a plain strong oak table,
seated in chair to match, the captain presents his left
profile. The steward stands facing him at the other
side of the table, if so deprecatory a stance as his
can be called standing. The mullioned thirteenth-century
window is open behind him. Near it in the
corner is a turret with a narrow arched doorway
leading to a winding stair which descends to the
courtyard. There is a stout fourlegged stool under
the table, and a wooden chest under the window.</p>

mouth, and handsome fighting chin. She comes
eagerly to the table, delighted at having penetrated
to Baudricourt’s presence at last, and full of hope

came here last year to represent his village in a lawsuit:
he is one of their notables. A farmer. Not a
gentleman farmer: he makes money by it, and lives
by it. Still, not a laborer. Not a mechanic. He might
have a cousin a lawyer, or in the Church. These

they can give a lot of bother to the authorities.

a very simple thing to take this girl away, humbugging
her into the belief that you are taking her to
the Dauphin. But if you get her into trouble, you

he touched the soil of our country the devil entered
into him and made him a black fiend. But at home,
in the place made for him by God, he was good. It
is always so. If I went into England against the will
of God to conquer England, and tried to live there

Our soldiers are always beaten because they are fighting
only to save their skins; and the shortest way
to save your skin is to run away. Our knights are
thinking only of the money they will make in ransoms:
it is not kill or be killed with them, but pay or
be paid. But I will teach them all to fight that the
will of God may be done in France; and then they
will drive the poor goddams before them like sheep.
You and Polly will live to see the day when there will
not be an English soldier on the soil of France; and
there will be but one king there: not the feudal English
king, but God’s French one.</span>

Dauphin, aged 26, really King Charles the Seventh
since the death of his father, but as yet uncrowned,
comes in through the curtains with a paper in his
hands. He is a poor creature physically; and the
current fashion of shaving closely, and hiding every
scrap of hair under the head-covering or headdress,
both by women and men, makes the worst of his appearance.
He has little narrow eyes, near together,
a long pendulous nose that droops over his thick
short upper lip, and the expression of a young dog
accustomed to be kicked, yet incorrigible and irrepressible.
But he is neither vulgar nor stupid; and
he has a cheeky humor which enables him to hold his
own in conversation. Just at present he is excited,

<div class="sd-out">

<p class="c018">Orleans, May 29th, 1429. Dunois, aged 26, is
pacing up and down a patch of ground on the south
bank of the silver Loire, commanding a long view of
the river in both directions. He has had his lance
stuck up with a pennon, which streams in a strong
east wind. His shield with its bend sinister lies beside
it. He has his commander’s baton in his hand. He
is well built, carrying his armor easily. His broad
brow and pointed chin give him an equilaterally triangular
face, already marked by active service and
responsibility, with the expression of a goodnatured
and capable man who has no affectations and no foolish
illusions. His page is sitting on the ground,
elbows on knees, cheeks on fists, idly watching the
water. It is evening; and both man and boy are
affected by the loveliness of the Loire.</p>

<p class="c018">A tent in the English camp. A bullnecked English
chaplain of 50 is sitting on a stool at a table, hard at

of Hours. The nobleman is enjoying himself: the

is an unoccupied leather stool on the nobleman’s left.

spread the pestilence in England; and to your shame
you let him die in his bed. We have such people here
in France too: I know the breed. It is cancerous:
if it be not cut out, stamped out, burnt out, it will
not stop until it has brought the whole body of human
society into sin and corruption, into waste and ruin.
By it an Arab camel driver drove Christ and His
Church out of Jerusalem, and ravaged his way west
like a wild beast until at last there stood only the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>Pyrenees and God’s mercy between France and damnation.
Yet what did the camel driver do at the beginning
more than this shepherd girl is doing? He
had his voices from the angel Gabriel: she has her
voices from St Catherine and St Margaret and the
Blessed Michael. He declared himself the messenger
of God, and wrote in God’s name to the kings of the
earth. Her letters to them are going forth daily.
It is not the Mother of God now to whom we must
look for intercession, but to Joan the Maid. What
will the world be like when The Church’s accumulated
wisdom and knowledge and experience, its councils
of learned, venerable pious men, are thrust into
the kennel by every ignorant laborer or dairymaid
whom the devil can puff up with the monstrous self-conceit
of being directly inspired from heaven? It
will be a world of blood, of fury, of devastation, of
each man striving for his own hand: in the end a
world wrecked back into barbarism. For now you
have only Mahomet and his dupes, and the Maid and
her dupes; but what will it be when every girl thinks
herself a Joan and every man a Mahomet? I shudder
to the very marrow of my bones when I think of
it. I have fought it all my life; and I will fight it to
the end. Let all this woman’s sins be forgiven her

Ghost; and if she does not recant in the dust before

their own good. I do not understand what your lordships
mean by Protestant and Nationalist: you are
too learned and subtle for a poor clerk like myself.
But I know as a matter of plain commonsense that
the woman is a rebel; and that is enough for me.
She rebels against Nature by wearing man’s clothes,
and fighting. She rebels against The Church by
usurping the divine authority of the Pope. She
<span class="pageno" id="Page_77">77</span>rebels against God by her damnable league with
Satan and his evil spirits against our army. And
all these rebellions are only excuses for her great
rebellion against England. That is not to be endured.
Let her perish. Let her burn. Let her not
infect the whole flock. It is expedient that one
woman die for the people.</span>

are in them. [<span class="sd-in">The cathedral clock chimes the quarter</span>]

I tell you, Bastard, your art of war is no
use, because your knights are no good for real fighting.
War is only a game to them, like tennis and
all their other games: they make rules as to what is
fair and what is not fair, and heap armor on themselves
and on their poor horses to keep out the arrows;
and when they fall they <span class="nonstandard">cant</span> get up, and
have to wait for their squires to come and lift them
to arrange about the ransom with the man that has
poked them off their horse. <span class="nonstandard">Cant</span> you see that all the
like of that is gone by and done with? What use is
armor against gunpowder? And if it was, do you
think men that are fighting for France and for God
<span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>will stop to bargain about ransoms, as half your
knights live by doing? No: they will fight to win;
and they will give up their lives out of their own hand
into the hand of God when they go into battle, as I
do. Common folks understand this. They cannot
afford armor and cannot pay ransoms; but they follow
me half naked into the moat and up the ladder
and over the wall. With them it is my life or thine,
and God defend the right! You may shake your
head, Jack; and Bluebeard may twirl his billygoat’s
beard and cock his nose at me; but remember the day
your knights and captains refused to follow me to
attack the English at Orleans! You locked the gates
to keep me in; and it was the townsfolk and the common
people that followed me and forced the gate,
and shewed you the way to fight in earnest.</span>

let the love in their eyes comfort me for the hate in

THE INQUISITOR
</span></span>
<span class="speech">[<span class="sd-in">dropping his blandness and
speaking very gravely</span>] Brother Martin: if you had
seen what I have seen of heresy, you would not think
it a light thing even in its most apparently harmless
and even lovable and pious origins. Heresy begins
with people who are to all appearance better than
their neighbors. A gentle and pious girl, or a young
man who has obeyed the command of our Lord by
giving all his riches to the poor, and putting on the
garb of poverty, the life of austerity, and the rule
of humility and charity, may be the founder of a
heresy that will wreck both Church and Empire if
not ruthlessly stamped out in time. The records of
the holy Inquisition are full of histories we dare not
give to the world, because they are beyond the belief
of honest men and innocent women; yet they all began
with saintly simpletons. I have seen this again
and again. Mark what I say: the woman who quarrels
with her clothes, and puts on the dress of a man,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_108">108</span>is like the man who throws off his fur gown and
dresses like John the Baptist: they are followed, as
surely as the night follows the day, by bands of wild
women and men who refuse to wear any clothes at
all. When maids will neither marry nor take regular
vows, and men reject marriage and exalt their lusts
into divine inspirations, then, as surely as the summer
follows the spring, they begin with polygamy,
and end by incest. Heresy at first seems innocent
and even laudable; but it ends in such a monstrous
horror of unnatural wickedness that the most tenderhearted
among you, if you saw it at work as I have
seen it, would clamor against the mercy of the
Church in dealing with it. For two hundred years
the Holy Office has striven with these diabolical
madnesses; and it knows that they begin always by
vain and ignorant persons setting up their own
judgment against the Church, and taking it upon
themselves to be the interpreters of God’s will. You
must not fall into the common error of mistaking
these simpletons for liars and hypocrites. They believe
honestly and sincerely that their diabolical
inspiration is divine. Therefore you must be on your
guard against your natural compassion. You are
all, I hope, merciful men: how else could you have
devoted your lives to the service of our gentle Savior?
You are going to see before you a young girl, pious
and chaste; for I must tell you, gentlemen, that the
things said of her by our English friends are supported
<span class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>by no evidence, whilst there is abundant
testimony that her excesses have been excesses of
religion and charity and not of worldliness and wantonness.
This girl is not one of those whose hard
features are the sign of hard hearts, and whose
brazen looks and lewd demeanor condemn them before
they are accused. The devilish pride that has
led her into her present peril has left no mark on
her countenance. Strange as it may seem to you, it
has even left no mark on her character outside those
special matters in which she is proud; so that you
will see a diabolical pride and a natural humility
seated side by side in the selfsame soul. Therefore
be on your guard. God forbid that I should tell you
to harden your hearts; for her punishment if we
condemn her will be so cruel that we should forfeit
our own hope of divine mercy were there one grain
of malice against her in our hearts. But if you hate
cruelty—and if any man here does not hate it I
command him on his soul’s salvation to quit this holy
court—I say, if you hate cruelty, remember that
nothing is so cruel in its consequences as the toleration
of heresy. Remember also that no court of
law can be so cruel as the common people are to those
whom they suspect of heresy. The heretic in the
hands of the Holy Office is safe from violence, is
assured of a fair trial, and cannot suffer death,
even when guilty, if repentance follows sin. Innumerable
lives of heretics have been saved because
<span class="pageno" id="Page_110">110</span>the Holy Office has taken them out of the hands of
the people, and because the people have yielded them
up, knowing that the Holy Office would deal with
them. Before the Holy Inquisition existed, and
even now when its officers are not within reach, the
unfortunate wretch suspected of heresy, perhaps
quite ignorantly and unjustly, is stoned, torn in
pieces, drowned, burned in his house with all his innocent
children, without a trial, unshriven, unburied
save as a dog is buried: all of them deeds hateful to
God and most cruel to man. Gentlemen: I am compassionate
by nature as well as by my profession;
and though the work I have to do may seem cruel
to those who do not know how much more cruel it
would be to leave it undone, I would go to the stake
myself sooner than do it if I did not know its
righteousness, its necessity, its essential mercy. I
ask you to address yourself to this trial in that conviction.
Anger is a bad counsellor: cast out anger.
Pity is sometimes a worse: cast out pity. But do
not cast out mercy. Remember only that justice
comes first. Have you anything to say, my lord,
before we proceed to trial?</span>

But this I will add. The crude heresies of which you
have told us are horrible; but their horror is like
that of the black death: they rage for a while and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>then die out, because sound and sensible men will not
under any incitement be reconciled to nakedness and
incest and polygamy and the like. <a id="tn-today"/>But we are confronted
today throughout Europe with a heresy
that is spreading among men not weak in mind nor
diseased in brain: nay, the stronger the mind, the
more obstinate the heretic. It is neither discredited
by fantastic extremes nor corrupted by the common
lusts of the flesh; but it, too, sets up the private
judgment of the single erring mortal against the
considered wisdom and experience of the Church.
The mighty structure of Catholic Christendom will
never be shaken by naked madmen or by the sins of
Moab and Ammon. But it may be betrayed from
within, and brought to barbarous ruin and desolation,
by this arch heresy which the English Commander
calls Protestantism.</span>

being stone dead. It is not the bread and water I
fear: I can live on bread: when have I asked for
more? It is no hardship to drink water if the water
be clean. Bread has no sorrow for me, and water
no affliction. But to shut me from the light of the
sky and the sight of the fields and flowers; to chain
my feet so that I can never again ride with the
soldiers nor climb the hills; to make me breathe foul
damp darkness, and keep from me everything that
brings me back to the love of God when your wickedness
and foolishness tempt me to hate Him: all this
is worse than the furnace in the Bible that was
heated seven times. I could do without my warhorse;
I could drag about in a skirt; I could let the banners
and the trumpets and the knights and soldiers pass
me and leave me behind as they leave the other

through the healthy frost, and the blessed blessed
church bells that send my angel voices floating to me

</div>

<div class="sd-out">

<p class="c018">A restless fitfully windy night in June 1456, full
of summer lightning after many days of heat. King
Charles the Seventh of France, formerly Joan’s
Dauphin, now Charles the Victorious, aged 51, is in
bed in one of his royal chateaux. The bed, raised on
a dais of two steps, is towards the side of the room
so as to avoid blocking a tall lancet window in the
middle. Its canopy bears the royal arms in embroidery.
Except for the canopy and the huge down
pillows there is nothing to distinguish it from a broad
settee with bed-clothes and a valance. Thus its occupant
is in full view from the foot.</p>

</div>

<div class="sd-out">

<p class="c011">Charles is not asleep: he is reading in bed, or rather
looking at the pictures in Fouquet’s Boccaccio with
his knees doubled up to make a reading desk. Beside
the bed on his left is a little table with a picture of
the Virgin, lighted by candles of painted wax. The
walls are hung from ceiling to floor with painted
curtains which stir at times in the draughts. At
first glance the prevailing yellow and red in these
hanging pictures is somewhat flamelike when the folds
breathe in the €wind.</p>

</div>

<div><span class="pageno" id="Page_141">141</span></div>
<div class="sd-out">

<p class="c011">The door is on Charles’s left, but in front of him
close to the corner farthest from him. A large watchman’s
rattle, handsomely designed and gaily painted,
is in the bed under his hand.</p>

</div>

<div class="sd-out">

<p class="c011">Charles turns a leaf. A distant clock strikes the
half-hour softly. Charles shuts the book with a clap;
throws it aside; snatches up the rattle; and whirls
it energetically, making a deafening clatter. Ladvenu
enters, 25 years older, strange and stark in
bearing, and still carrying the cross from Rouen.
Charles evidently does not expect him; for he springs
out of bed on the farther side from the door.</p>

<span class="speech">At the trial which sent a saint to the
stake as a heretic and a sorceress, the truth was told;
the law was upheld; mercy was shewn beyond all
custom; no wrong was done but the final and dreadful
wrong of the lying sentence and the pitiless fire.
At this inquiry from which I have just come, there
was shameless perjury, courtly corruption, calumny
of the dead who did their duty according to their
lights, cowardly evasion of the issue, testimony made
of idle tales that could not impose on a ploughboy.
Yet out of this insult to justice, this defamation of
the Church, this orgy of lying and foolishness, the
truth is set in the noonday sun on the hilltop; the
white robe of innocence is cleansed from the smirch
of the burning faggots; the holy life is sanctified;
the true heart that lived through the flame is consecrated;
a great lie is silenced for ever; and a great
wrong is set right before all men.</span>

<p class="c003">George Bernard Shaw had strong beliefs about typography and English spelling reform. In printing his plays, he insisted on leaving out the apostrophes (which he called “uncouth bacillae”) in contractions like “cant” and “dont.” Shaw did use apostrophes in possessives and in some contractions, such as “it’s,” “I’ll,” “she’s,” and “that’s.” He also refused to use dashes in numbers like “twentyfive.”</p>

<p class="c004">This edition omits apostrophes and dashes where Shaw omitted them, leaves them in where he left them in, and makes changes only for consistency, in a few cases listed below. In the HTML version of this text, these words punctuated in nonstandard ways are marked with an invisible tag, &lt;span class="nonstandard"&gt;.</p>

<p class="c004">In the HTML version, semantic tagging has been added to the play. The tags are:</p>
<table class="table1">
<colgroup>
<col class="colwidth60"/>
<col class="colwidth39"/>
</colgroup>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="c019">A line of dialogue:</td>
    <td class="c020">&lt;div class="line"&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="c019">The character speaking:</td>
    <td class="c020">&lt;span class="speaker"&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="c019">The remainder of the line:</td>
    <td class="c020">&lt;span class="speech"&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="c019">A stage direction inside a line:</td>
    <td class="c020">&lt;span class="sd-in"&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="c019">A stage direction on its own line:</td>
    <td class="c020">&lt;span class="sd-out"&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p class="c004">The punctuation of stage directions is inconsistent in the printed text and has been left as printed.</p>

<p class="c004">In addition to italics, Shaw sometimes showed emphasis with extra space between the letters of a word; this is shown like <strong>this</strong>.</p>
