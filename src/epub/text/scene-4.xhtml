				<h2 class="c017">SCENE IV</h2>
			</div>
			<scene>
				<p class="c018">A tent in the English camp. A bullnecked English chaplain of 50 is sitting on a stool at a table, hard at work writing. At the other side of the table an imposing nobleman, aged 46, is seated in a handsome chair turning over the leaves of an illuminated Book of Hours. The nobleman is enjoying himself: the chaplain is struggling with suppressed wrath. There is an unoccupied leather stool on the nobleman’s left. The table is on his right.</p>
			</scene>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Now this is what I call workmanship. There is nothing on earth more exquisite than a bonny book, with well-placed columns of rich black writing in beautiful borders, and illuminated pictures cunningly inset. But nowadays, instead of looking at books, people read them. A book might as well be one of those orders for bacon and bran that you are scribbling.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>I must say, my lord, you take our situation very coolly. Very coolly indeed.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>supercilious</sd-in> What is the matter?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>The matter, my lord, is that we English have been defeated.</speech>
			</line>
			<div>
				
			</div>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>That happens, you know. It is only in history books and ballads that the enemy is always defeated.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>But we are being defeated over and over again. First, Orleans⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>poohpoohing</sd-in> Oh, Orleans!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>I know what you are going to say, my lord: that was a clear case of witchcraft and sorcery. But we are still being defeated. Jargeau, Meung, Beugency, just like Orleans. And now we have been butchered at Patay, and Sir John Talbot taken prisoner. <sd-in>He throws down his pen, almost in tears</sd-in> I feel it, my lord: I feel it very deeply. I cannot bear to see my countrymen defeated by a parcel of foreigners.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh! you are an Englishman, are you?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>Certainly not, my lord: I am a gentleman. Still, like your lordship, I was born in England; and it makes a difference.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>You are attached to the soil, eh?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>It pleases your lordship to be satirical at my expense: your greatness privileges you to be so with impunity. But your lordship knows very well that I am not attached to the soil in a vulgar manner, like a serf. Still, I have a feeling about it; <sd-in>with growing agitation</sd-in> and I am not ashamed of it; and <sd-in>rising wildly</sd-in> by God, if this goes on any longer I will fling my cassock to the devil, and take arms myself, and strangle the accursed witch with my own hands.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>laughing at him goodnaturedly</sd-in> So you shall, chaplain: so you shall, if we can do nothing better. But not yet, not quite yet.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>resumes his seat very sulkily</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>airily</sd-in> I should not care very much about the witch⁠—you see, I have made my pilgrimage to the Holy Land; and the Heavenly Powers, for their own credit, can hardly allow me to be worsted by a village sorceress⁠—but the Bastard of Orleans is a harder nut to crack; and as he has been to the Holy Land too, honors are easy between us as far as that goes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>He is only a Frenchman, my lord.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>A Frenchman! Where did you pick up that expression? Are these Burgundians and Bretons and Picards and Gascons beginning to call themselves Frenchmen, just as our fellows are beginning to call themselves Englishmen? They actually talk of France and England as their countries. <strong>Theirs</strong>, if you please! What is to become of me and you if that way of thinking comes into fashion?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>Why, my lord? Can it hurt us?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Men cannot serve two masters. If this cant of serving their country once takes hold of them, goodbye to the authority of their feudal lords, and goodbye to the authority of the Church. That is, goodbye to you and me.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>I hope I am a faithful servant of the Church; and there are only six cousins between me and the barony of Stogumber, which was created by the Conqueror. But is that any reason why I should stand by and see Englishmen beaten by a French bastard and a witch from Lousy Champagne?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Easy, man, easy: we shall burn the witch and beat the bastard all in good time. Indeed I am waiting at present for the Bishop of Beauvais, to arrange the burning with him. He has been turned out of his diocese by her faction.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>You have first to catch her, my lord.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Or buy her. I will offer a king’s ransom.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>A king’s ransom! For that slut!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>One has to leave a margin. Some of Charles’s people will sell her to the Burgundians; the Burgundians will sell her to us; and there will probably be three or four middlemen who will expect their little commissions.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>Monstrous. It is all those scoundrels of Jews: they get in every time money changes hands. I would not leave a Jew alive in Christendom if I had my way.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Why not? The Jews generally give value. They make you pay; but they deliver the goods. In my experience the men who want something for nothing are invariably Christians.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>A page appears.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE PAGE.</speaker>
				<speech>The Right Reverend the Bishop of Beauvais: Monseigneur Cauchon.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>Cauchon, aged about 60, comes in. The page withdraws. The two Englishmen rise.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE NOBLEMAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>with effusive courtesy</sd-in> My dear Bishop, how good of you to come! Allow me to introduce myself: Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, at your service.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Your lordship’s fame is well known to me.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>This reverend cleric is Master John de Stogumber.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>glibly</sd-in> John Bowyer Spenser Neville de Stogumber, at your service, my lord: Bachelor of Theology, and Keeper of the Private Seal to His Eminence the Cardinal of Winchester.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>to Cauchon</sd-in> You call him the Cardinal of England, I believe. Our king’s uncle.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Messire John de Stogumber: I am always the very good friend of His Eminence. <sd-in>He extends his hand to the chaplain, who kisses his ring</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Do me the honor to be seated. <sd-in>He gives Cauchon his chair, placing it at the head of the table</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>Cauchon accepts the place of honor with a grave inclination. Warwick fetches the leather stool carelessly, and sits in his former place. The chaplain goes back to his chair.</sd-row>
			<sd-row>Though Warwick has taken second place in calculated deference to the Bishop, he assumes the lead in opening the proceedings as a matter of course. He is still cordial and expansive; but there is a new note in his voice which means that he is coming to business.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Well, my Lord Bishop, you find us in one of our unlucky moments. Charles is to be crowned at Rheims, practically by the young woman from Lorraine; and⁠—I must not deceive you, nor flatter your hopes⁠—we cannot prevent it. I suppose it will make a great difference to Charles’s position.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Undoubtedly. It is a masterstroke of The Maid’s.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>again agitated</sd-in> We were not fairly beaten, my lord. No Englishman is ever fairly beaten.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>raises his eyebrow slightly, then quickly composes his face</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Our friend here takes the view that the young woman is a sorceress. It would, I presume, be the duty of your reverend lordship to denounce her to the Inquisition, and have her burnt for that offence.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>If she were captured in my diocese: yes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>feeling that they are getting on capitally</sd-in> Just so. Now I suppose there can be no reasonable doubt that she is a sorceress.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>Not the least. An arrant witch.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>gently reproving the interruption</sd-in> We are asking for the Bishop’s opinion, Messire John.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>We shall have to consider not merely our own opinions here, but the opinions⁠—the prejudices, if you like⁠—of a French court.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>correcting</sd-in> A Catholic court, my lord.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Catholic courts are composed of mortal men, like other courts, however sacred their function and inspiration may be. And if the men are Frenchmen, as the modern fashion calls them, I am afraid the bare fact that an English army has been defeated by a French one will not convince them that there is any sorcery in the matter.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>What! Not when the famous Sir John Talbot himself has been defeated and actually taken prisoner by a drab from the ditches of Lorraine!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Sir John Talbot, we all know, is a fierce and formidable soldier, Messire; but I have yet to learn that he is an able general. And though it pleases you to say that he has been defeated by this girl, some of us may be disposed to give a little of the credit to Dunois.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>contemptuously</sd-in> The Bastard of Orleans!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Let me remind⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<div>
				
			</div>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>interposing</sd-in> I know what you are going to say, my lord. Dunois defeated me at Montargis.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>bowing</sd-in> I take that as evidence that the Seigneur Dunois is a very able commander indeed.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Your lordship is the flower of courtesy. I admit, on our side, that Talbot is a mere fighting animal, and that it probably served him right to be taken at Patay.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>chafing</sd-in> My lord: at Orleans this woman had her throat pierced by an English arrow, and was seen to cry like a child from the pain of it. It was a death wound; yet she fought all day; and when our men had repulsed all her attacks like true Englishmen, she walked alone to the wall of our fort with a white banner in her hand; and our men were paralyzed, and could neither shoot nor strike whilst the French fell on them and drove them on to the bridge, which immediately burst into flames and crumbled under them, letting them down into the river, where they were drowned in heaps. Was this your bastard’s generalship? or were those flames the flames of hell, conjured up by witchcraft?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>You will forgive Messire John’s vehemence, my lord; but he has put our case. Dunois is a great captain, we admit; but why could he do nothing until the witch came?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>I do not say that there were no supernatural powers on her side. But the names on that white banner were not the names of Satan and Beelzebub, but the blessed names of our Lord and His holy mother. And your commander who was drowned⁠—Clahz-da I think you call him⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Glasdale. Sir William Glasdale.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Glass-dell, thank you. He was no saint; and many of our people think that he was drowned for his blasphemies against The Maid.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>beginning to look very dubious</sd-in> Well, what are we to infer from all this, my lord? Has The Maid converted you?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>If she had, my lord, I should have known better than to have trusted myself here within your grasp.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>blandly deprecating</sd-in> Oh! oh! My lord!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>If the devil is making use of this girl⁠—and I believe he is⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>reassured</sd-in> Ah! You hear, Messire John? I knew your lordship would not fail us. Pardon my interruption. Proceed.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>If it be so, the devil has longer views than you give him credit for.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Indeed? In what way? Listen to this, Messire John.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>If the devil wanted to damn a country girl, do you think so easy a task would cost him the winning of half a dozen battles? No, my lord: any trumpery imp could do that much if the girl could be damned at all. The Prince of Darkness does not condescend to such cheap drudgery. When he strikes, he strikes at the Catholic Church, whose realm is the whole spiritual world. When he damns, he damns the souls of the entire human race. Against that dreadful design The Church stands ever on guard. And it is as one of the instruments of that design that I see this girl. She is inspired, but diabolically inspired.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>I told you she was a witch.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>fiercely</sd-in> She is not a witch. She is a heretic.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>What difference does that make?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>You, a priest, ask me that! You English are strangely blunt in the mind. All these things that you call witchcraft are capable of a natural explanation. The woman’s miracles would not impose on a rabbit: she does not claim them as miracles herself. What do her victories prove but that she has a better head on her shoulders than your swearing Glass-dells and mad bull Talbots, and that the courage of faith, even though it be a false faith, will always outstay the courage of wrath?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>hardly able to believe his ears</sd-in> Does your lordship compare Sir John Talbot, the heir to the earldom of Shrewsbury, to a mad bull?!!!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>It would not be seemly for you to do so, Messire John, as you are still six removes from a barony. But as I am an earl, and Talbot is only a knight, I may make bold to accept the comparison. <sd-in>To the Bishop</sd-in> My lord: I wipe the slate as far as the witchcraft goes. None the less, we must burn the woman.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>I cannot burn her. The Church cannot take life. And my first duty is to seek this girl’s salvation.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>No doubt. But you do burn people occasionally.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>No. When the Church cuts off an obstinate heretic as a dead branch from the tree of life, the heretic is handed over to the secular arm. The church has no part in what the secular arm may see fit to do.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Precisely. And I shall be the secular arm in this case. Well, my lord, hand over your dead branch; and I will see that the fire is ready for it. If you will answer for the Church’s part, I will answer for the secular part.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>with smouldering anger</sd-in> I can answer for nothing. You great lords are too prone to treat the Church as a mere political convenience.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>smiling and propitiatory</sd-in> Not in England, I assure you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>In England more than anywhere else. No, my lord: the soul of this village girl is of equal value with yours or your king’s before the throne of God; and my first duty is to save it. I will not suffer your lordship to smile at me as if I were repeating a meaningless form of words, and it were well understood between us that I should betray the girl to you. I am no mere political bishop: my faith is to me what your honor is to you; and if there be a loophole through which this baptized child of God can creep to her salvation, I shall guide her to it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>rising in a fury</sd-in> You are a traitor.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>springing up</sd-in> You lie, priest. <sd-in>Trembling with rage</sd-in> If you dare do what this woman has done⁠—set your country above the holy Catholic Church⁠—you shall go to the fire with her.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>My lord: I⁠—I went too far. I⁠—<sd-in>he sits down with a submissive gesture</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>who has risen apprehensively</sd-in> My lord: I apologize to you for the word used by Messire John de Stogumber. It does not mean in England what it does in France. In your language traitor means betrayer: one who is perfidious, treacherous, unfaithful, disloyal. In our country it means simply one who is not wholly devoted to our English interests.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>I am sorry: I did not understand. <sd-in>He subsides into his chair with dignity.</sd-in></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>resuming his seat, much relieved</sd-in> I must apologize on my own account if I have seemed to take the burning of this poor girl too lightly. When one has seen whole countrysides burnt over and over again as mere items in military routine, one has to grow a very thick skin. Otherwise one might go mad: at all events, I should. May I venture to assume that your lordship also, having to see so many heretics burnt from time to time, is compelled to take⁠—shall I say a professional view of what would otherwise be a very horrible incident?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Yes: it is a painful duty: even, as you say, a horrible one. But in comparison with the horror of heresy it is less than nothing. I am not thinking of this girl’s body, which will suffer for a few moments only, and which must in any event die in some more or less painful manner, but of her soul, which may suffer to all eternity.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Just so; and God grant that her soul may be saved! But the practical problem would seem to be how to save her soul without saving her body. For we must face it, my lord: if this cult of The Maid goes on, our cause is lost.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>his voice broken like that of a man who has been crying</sd-in> May I speak, my lord?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Really, Messire John, I had rather you did not, unless you can keep your temper.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>It is only this. I speak under correction; but The Maid is full of deceit: she pretends to be devout. Her prayers and confessions are endless. How can she be accused of heresy when she neglects no observance of a faithful daughter of The Church?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>flaming up</sd-in> A faithful daughter of The Church! The Pope himself at his proudest dare not presume as this woman presumes. She acts as if she herself were The Church. She brings the message of God to Charles; and The Church must stand aside. She will crown him in the cathedral of Rheims: she, not The Church! She sends letters to the king of England giving him God’s command through her to return to his island on pain of God’s vengeance, which she will execute. Let me tell you that the writing of such letters was the practice of the accursed Mahomet, the anti-Christ. Has she ever in all her utterances said one word of The Church? Never. It is always God and herself.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>What can you expect? A beggar on horseback! Her head is turned.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Who has turned it? The devil. And for a mighty purpose. He is spreading this heresy everywhere. The man Hus, burnt only thirteen years ago at Constance, infected all Bohemia with it. A man named WcLeef, himself an anointed priest, spread the pestilence in England; and to your shame you let him die in his bed. We have such people here in France too: I know the breed. It is cancerous: if it be not cut out, stamped out, burnt out, it will not stop until it has brought the whole body of human society into sin and corruption, into waste and ruin. By it an Arab camel driver drove Christ and His Church out of Jerusalem, and ravaged his way west like a wild beast until at last there stood only the Pyrenees and God’s mercy between France and damnation. Yet what did the camel driver do at the beginning more than this shepherd girl is doing? He had his voices from the angel Gabriel: she has her voices from St. Catherine and St. Margaret and the Blessed Michael. He declared himself the messenger of God, and wrote in God’s name to the kings of the earth. Her letters to them are going forth daily. It is not the Mother of God now to whom we must look for intercession, but to Joan the Maid. What will the world be like when The Church’s accumulated wisdom and knowledge and experience, its councils of learned, venerable pious men, are thrust into the kennel by every ignorant laborer or dairymaid whom the devil can puff up with the monstrous self-conceit of being directly inspired from heaven? It will be a world of blood, of fury, of devastation, of each man striving for his own hand: in the end a world wrecked back into barbarism. For now you have only Mahomet and his dupes, and the Maid and her dupes; but what will it be when every girl thinks herself a Joan and every man a Mahomet? I shudder to the very marrow of my bones when I think of it. I have fought it all my life; and I will fight it to the end. Let all this woman’s sins be forgiven her except only this sin; for it is the sin against the Holy Ghost; and if she does not recant in the dust before the world, and submit herself to the last inch of her soul to her Church, to the fire she shall go if she once falls into my hand.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>unimpressed</sd-in> You feel strongly about it, naturally.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Do not you?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>I am a soldier, not a churchman. As a pilgrim I saw something of the Mahometans. They were not so illbred as I had been led to believe. In some respects their conduct compared favorably with ours.</speech>
			</line>

				<speech><sd-in>displeased</sd-in> I have noticed this before. Men go to the East to convert the infidels. And the infidels pervert them. The Crusader comes back more than half a Saracen. Not to mention that all Englishmen are born heretics.</speech>

				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>Englishmen heretics!!! <sd-in>Appealing to Warwick</sd-in> My lord: must we endure this? His lordship is beside himself. How can what an Englishman believes be heresy? It is a contradiction in terms.</speech>

				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>I absolve you, Messire de Stogumber, on the ground of invincible ignorance. The thick air of your country does not breed theologians.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>You would not say so if you heard us quarrelling about religion, my lord! I am sorry you think I must be either a heretic or a blockhead because, as a travelled man, I know that the followers of Mahomet profess great respect for our Lord, and are more ready to forgive St. Peter for being a fisherman than your lordship is to forgive Mahomet for being a camel driver. But at least we can proceed in this matter without bigotry.</speech>

				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>When men call the zeal of the Christian Church bigotry I know what to think.</speech>

				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>They are only east and west views of the same thing.</speech>

			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>bitterly ironical</sd-in> Only east and west! Only!!</speech>

				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, my Lord Bishop, I am not gainsaying you. You will carry The Church with you; but you have to carry the nobles also. To my mind there is a stronger case against The Maid than the one you have so forcibly put. Frankly, I am not afraid of this girl becoming another Mahomet, and superseding The Church by a great heresy. I think you exaggerate that risk. But have you noticed that in these letters of hers, she proposes to all the kings of Europe, as she has already pressed on Charles, a transaction which would wreck the whole social structure of Christendom?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Wreck The Church. I tell you so.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>whose patience is wearing out</sd-in> My lord: pray get The Church out of your head for a moment; and remember that there are temporal institutions in the world as well as spiritual ones. I and my peers represent the feudal aristocracy as you represent The Church. We are the temporal power. Well, do you not see how this girl’s idea strikes at us?</speech>
			</line>
			<div>
				
			</div>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>How does her idea strike at you, except as it strikes at all of us, through The Church?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Her idea is that the kings should give their realms to God, and then reign as God’s bailiffs.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>not interested</sd-in> Quite sound theologically, my lord. But the king will hardly care, provided he reign. It is an abstract idea: a mere form of words.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>By no means. It is a cunning device to supersede the aristocracy, and make the king sole and absolute autocrat. Instead of the king being merely the first among his peers, he becomes their master. That we cannot suffer: we call no man master. Nominally we hold our lands and dignities from the king, because there must be a keystone to the arch of human society; but we hold our lands in our own hands, and defend them with our own swords and those of our own tenants. Now by The Maid’s doctrine the king will take our lands⁠—our lands!⁠—and make them a present to God; and God will then vest them wholly in the king.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Need you fear that? You are the makers of kings after all. York or Lancaster in England, Lancaster or Valois in France: they reign according to your pleasure.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Yes: but only as long as the people follow their feudal lords, and know the king only as a travelling show, owning nothing but the highway that belongs to everybody. If the people’s thoughts and hearts were turned to the king, and their lords became only the king’s servants in their eyes, the king could break us across his knee one by one; and then what should we be but liveried courtiers in his halls?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Still you need not fear, my lord. Some men are born kings; and some are born statesmen. <a id="tn-thetwo"/>The two are seldom the same. Where would the king find counsellors to plan and carry out such a policy for him?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>with a not too friendly smile</sd-in> Perhaps in the Church, my lord.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>with an equally sour smile, shrugs his shoulders, and does not contradict him</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Strike down the barons; and the cardinals will have it all their own way.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>conciliatory, dropping his polemical tone</sd-in> My lord: we shall not defeat The Maid if we strike against one another. I know well that there is a Will to Power in the world. I know that while it lasts there will be a struggle between the Emperor and the Pope, between the dukes and the political cardinals, between the barons and the kings. The devil divides us and governs. I see you are no friend to The Church: you are an earl first and last, as I am a churchman first and last. But can we not sink our differences in the face of a common enemy? I see now that what is in your mind is not that this girl has never once mentioned The Church, and thinks only of God and herself, but that she has never once mentioned the peerage, and thinks only of the king and herself.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Quite so. These two ideas of hers are the same idea at bottom. It goes deep, my lord. It is the protest of the individual soul against the interference of priest or peer between the private man and his God. I should call it Protestantism if I had to find a name for it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>looking hard at him</sd-in> You understand it wonderfully well, my lord. Scratch an Englishman, and find a Protestant.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>playing the pink of courtesy</sd-in> I think you are not entirely void of sympathy with The Maid’s secular heresy, my lord. I leave you to find a name for it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>You mistake me, my lord. I have no sympathy with her political presumptions. But as a priest I have gained a knowledge of the minds of the common people; and there you will find yet another most dangerous idea. I can express it only by such phrases as France for the French, England for the English, Italy for the Italians, Spain for the Spanish, and so forth. It is sometimes so narrow and bitter in country folk that it surprises me that this country girl can rise above the idea of her village for its villagers. But she can. She does. When she threatens to drive the English from the soil of France she is undoubtedly thinking of the whole extent of country in which French is spoken. To her the French-speaking people are what the Holy Scriptures describe as a nation. Call this side of her heresy Nationalism if you will: I can find you no better name for it. I can only tell you that it is essentially anti-Catholic and anti-Christian; for the Catholic Church knows only one realm, and that is the realm of Christ’s kingdom. Divide that kingdom into nations, and you dethrone Christ. Dethrone Christ, and who will stand between our throats and the sword? The world will perish in a welter of war.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Well, if you will burn the Protestant, I will burn the Nationalist, though perhaps I shall not carry Messire John with me there. England for the English will appeal to him.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN.</speaker>
				<speech>Certainly England for the English goes without saying: it is the simple law of nature. But this woman denies to England her legitimate conquests, given her by God because of her peculiar fitness to rule over less civilized races for their own good. I do not understand what your lordships mean by Protestant and Nationalist: you are too learned and subtle for a poor clerk like myself. But I know as a matter of plain commonsense that the woman is a rebel; and that is enough for me. She rebels against Nature by wearing man’s clothes, and fighting. She rebels against The Church by usurping the divine authority of the Pope. She rebels against God by her damnable league with Satan and his evil spirits against our army. And all these rebellions are only excuses for her great rebellion against England. That is not to be endured. Let her perish. Let her burn. Let her not infect the whole flock. It is expedient that one woman die for the people.</speech>

			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>rising also, but in protest</sd-in> I will not imperil my soul. I will uphold the justice of the Church. I will strive to the utmost for this woman’s salvation.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>I am sorry for the poor girl. I hate these severities. I will spare her if I can.</speech>
			</line>

				<speaker>THE CHAPLAIN</speaker>
