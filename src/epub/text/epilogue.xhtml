				<h2 epub:type="title">Epilogue</h2>
			</div>
			<p>A restless fitfully windy night in June 1456, full of summer lightning after many days of heat. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">King Charles the Seventh</b> of France, formerly <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Joan’s</b> Dauphin, now Charles the Victorious, aged 51, is in bed in one of his royal châteaux. The bed, raised on a dais of two steps, is towards the side of the room so as to avoid blocking a tall lancet window in the middle. Its canopy bears the royal arms in embroidery. Except for the canopy and the huge down pillows there is nothing to distinguish it from a broad settee with bedclothes and a valance. Thus its occupant is in full view from the foot.</p>
			<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Charles</b> is not asleep: he is reading in bed, or rather looking at the pictures in Fouquet’s Boccaccio with his knees doubled up to make a reading desk. Beside the bed on his left is a little table with a picture of the Virgin, lighted by candles of painted wax. The walls are hung from ceiling to floor with painted curtains which stir at times in the draughts. At first glance the prevailing yellow and red in these hanging pictures is somewhat flamelike when the folds breathe in the wind.</p>
			<p>The door is on <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Charles’s</b> left, but in front of him close to the corner farthest from him. A large watchman’s rattle, handsomely designed and gaily painted, is in the bed under his hand.</p>
			<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Charles</b> turns a leaf. A distant clock strikes the half-hour softly. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Charles</b> shuts the book with a clap; throws it aside; snatches up the rattle; and whirls it energetically, making a deafening clatter. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Ladvenu</b> enters, 25 years older, strange and stark in bearing, and still carrying the cross from Rouen. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Charles</b> evidently does not expect him; for he springs out of bed on the farther side from the door.</p>

At this inquiry from which I have just come, there was shameless perjury, courtly corruption, calumny of the dead who did their duty according to their lights, cowardly evasion of the issue, testimony made of idle tales that could not impose on a ploughboy. Yet out of this insult to justice, this defamation of the Church, this orgy of lying and foolishness, the truth is set in the noonday sun on the hilltop; the white robe of innocence is cleansed from the smirch of the burning faggots; the holy life is sanctified; the true heart that lived through the flame is consecrated; a great lie is silenced forever; and a great wrong is set right before all men.</td>
