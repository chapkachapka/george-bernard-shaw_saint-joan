				<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>
			</div>
			<scene>
				<p>A restless fitfully windy night in June 1456, full of summer lightning after many days of heat. King Charles the Seventh of France, formerly Joan’s Dauphin, now Charles the Victorious, aged 51, is in bed in one of his royal chateaux. The bed, raised on a dais of two steps, is towards the side of the room so as to avoid blocking a tall lancet window in the middle. Its canopy bears the royal arms in embroidery. Except for the canopy and the huge down pillows there is nothing to distinguish it from a broad settee with bed-clothes and a valance. Thus its occupant is in full view from the foot.</p>
				<p>Charles is not asleep: he is reading in bed, or rather looking at the pictures in Fouquet’s Boccaccio with his knees doubled up to make a reading desk. Beside the bed on his left is a little table with a picture of the Virgin, lighted by candles of painted wax. The walls are hung from ceiling to floor with painted curtains which stir at times in the draughts. At first glance the prevailing yellow and red in these hanging pictures is somewhat flamelike when the folds breathe in the €wind.</p>
				<p>The door is on Charles’s left, but in front of him close to the corner farthest from him. A large watchman’s rattle, handsomely designed and gaily painted, is in the bed under his hand.</p>
				<p>Charles turns a leaf. A distant clock strikes the half-hour softly. Charles shuts the book with a clap; throws it aside; snatches up the rattle; and whirls it energetically, making a deafening clatter. Ladvenu enters, 25 years older, strange and stark in bearing, and still carrying the cross from Rouen. Charles evidently does not expect him; for he springs out of bed on the farther side from the door.</p>

			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Who are you? Where is my gentleman of the bedchamber? What do you want?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>solemnly</sd-in> I bring you glad tidings of great joy. Rejoice, O king; for the taint is removed from your blood, and the stain from your crown. Justice, long delayed, is at last triumphant.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>What are you talking about? Who are you?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>I am Brother Martin.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>And who, saving your reverence, may Brother Martin be?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>I held this cross when The Maid perished in the fire. <span class="nonstandard">Twentyfive</span> years have passed since then: nearly ten thousand days. And on every one of those days I have prayed God to justify His daughter on earth as she is justified in heaven.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>reassured, sitting down on the foot of the bed</sd-in> Oh, I remember now. I have heard of you. You have a bee in your bonnet about The Maid. Have you been at the inquiry?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>I have given my testimony.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Is it over?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>It is over.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Satisfactorily?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>The ways of God are very strange.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>How so?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>At the trial which sent a saint to the stake as a heretic and a sorceress, the truth was told; the law was upheld; mercy was shewn beyond all custom; no wrong was done but the final and dreadful wrong of the lying sentence and the pitiless fire. At this inquiry from which I have just come, there was shameless perjury, courtly corruption, calumny of the dead who did their duty according to their lights, cowardly evasion of the issue, testimony made of idle tales that could not impose on a ploughboy. Yet out of this insult to justice, this defamation of the Church, this orgy of lying and foolishness, the truth is set in the noonday sun on the hilltop; the white robe of innocence is cleansed from the smirch of the burning faggots; the holy life is sanctified; the true heart that lived through the flame is consecrated; a great lie is silenced for ever; and a great wrong is set right before all men.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>My friend: provided they can no longer say that I was crowned by a witch and a heretic, I shall not fuss about how the trick has been done. Joan would not have fussed about it if it came all right in the end: she was not that sort: I knew her. Is her rehabilitation complete? I made it pretty clear that there was to be no nonsense about it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>It is solemnly declared that her judges were full of corruption, cozenage, fraud and malice. Four falsehoods.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Never mind the falsehoods: her judges are dead.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>The sentence on her is broken, annulled, annihilated, set aside as non-existent, without value or effect.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Good. Nobody can challenge my consecration now, can they?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>Not Charlemagne nor King David himself was more sacredly crowned.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>rising</sd-in> Excellent. Think of what that means to me!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>I think of what it means to her!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>You cannot. None of us ever knew what anything meant to her. She was like nobody else; and she must take care of herself wherever she is; for <em>I</em> cannot take care of her; and neither can you, whatever you may think: you are not big enough. But I will tell you this about her. If you could bring her back to life, they would burn her again within six months, for all their present adoration of her. And you would hold up the cross, too, just the same. So <sd-in>crossing himself</sd-in> let her rest; and let you and I mind our own business, and not meddle with hers.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>LADVENU.</speaker>
				<speech>God forbid that I should have no share in her, nor she in me! <sd-in>He turns and strides out as he came, saying</sd-in> Henceforth my path will not lie through palaces, nor my conversation be with kings.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>following him towards the door, and shouting after him</sd-in> Much good may it do you, holy man! <sd-in>He returns to the middle of the chamber, where he halts, and says quizzically to himself</sd-in> That was a funny chap. How did he get in? Where are my people? <sd-in>He goes impatiently to the bed, and swings the rattle. A rush of wind through the open door sets the walls swaying agitatedly. The candles go out. He calls in the darkness</sd-in> Hallo! Someone come and shut the windows: everything is being blown all over the place. <sd-in>A flash of summer lightning shews up the lancet windows. A figure is seen in silhouette against it</sd-in> Who is there? Who is that? Help! Murder! <sd-in>Thunder. He jumps into bed, and hides under the clothes</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN’S VOICE.</speaker>
				<speech>Easy, Charlie, easy. What art making all that noise for? No one can hear thee. <span class="nonstandard">Thourt</span> asleep. <sd-in>She is dimly seen in a pallid greenish light by the bedside</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>peeping out</sd-in> Joan! Are you a ghost, Joan?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Hardly even that, lad. Can a poor burnt-up lass have a ghost? I am but a dream that <span class="nonstandard">thourt</span> dreaming. <sd-in>The light increases: they become plainly visible as he sits up</sd-in> Thou looks older, lad.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>I am older. Am I really asleep?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Fallen asleep over thy silly book.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>That’s funny.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Not so funny as that I am dead, is it?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Are you really dead?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>As dead as anybody ever is, laddie. I am out of the body.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Just fancy! Did it hurt much?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Did what hurt much?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Being burnt.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, that! I cannot remember very well. I think it did at first; but then it all got mixed up; and I was not in my right mind until I was free of the body. But do not thou go handling fire and thinking it will not hurt thee. How hast been ever since?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, not so bad. Do you know, I actually lead my army out and win battles? Down into the moat up to my waist in mud and blood. Up the ladders with the stones and hot pitch raining down. Like you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>No! Did I make a man of thee after all, Charlie?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>I am Charles the Victorious now. I had to be brave because you were. Agnes put a little pluck into me too.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Agnes! Who was Agnes?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Agnes Sorel. A woman I fell in love with. I dream of her often. I never dreamed of you before.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Is she dead, like me?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Yes. But she was not like you. She was very beautiful.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>laughing heartily</sd-in> Ha ha! I was no beauty: I was always a rough one: a regular soldier. I might almost as well have been a man. Pity I <span class="nonstandard">wasnt</span>: I should not have bothered you all so much then. But my head was in the skies; and the glory of God was upon me; and, man or woman, I should have bothered you as long as your noses were in the mud. Now tell me what has happened since you wise men knew no better than to make a heap of cinders of me?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Your mother and brothers have sued the courts to have your case tried over again. And the courts have declared that your judges were full of corruption and cozenage, fraud and malice.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Not they. They were as honest a lot of poor fools as ever burned their betters.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>The sentence on you is broken, annihilated, annulled: null, non-existent, without value or effect.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>I was burnt all the same. Can they unburn me?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>If they could, they would think twice before they did it. But they have decreed that a beautiful cross be placed where the stake stood, for your perpetual memory and for your salvation.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>It is the memory and the salvation that sanctify the cross, not the cross that sanctifies the memory and the salvation. <sd-in>She turns away, forgetting him</sd-in> I shall outlast that cross. I shall be remembered when men will have forgotten where Rouen stood.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>There you go with your self-conceit, the same as ever! I think you might say a word of thanks to me for having had justice done at last.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>appearing at the window between them</sd-in> Liar!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Thank you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Why, if it <span class="nonstandard">isnt</span> Peter Cauchon! How are you, Peter? What luck have you had since you burnt me?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>None. I arraign the justice of Man. It is not the justice of God.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Still dreaming of justice, Peter? See what justice came to with me! But what has happened to thee? Art dead or alive?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Dead. Dishonored. They pursued me beyond the grave. They excommunicated my dead body: they dug it up and flung it into the common sewer.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Your dead body did not feel the spade and the sewer as my live body felt the fire.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>But this thing that they have done against me hurts justice; destroys faith; saps the foundation of the Church. The solid earth sways like the treacherous sea beneath the feet of men and spirits alike when the innocent are slain in the name of law, and their wrongs are undone by slandering the pure of heart.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Well, well, Peter, I hope men will be the better for remembering me; and they would not remember me so well if you had not burnt me.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>They will be the worse for remembering me: they will see in me evil triumphing over good, falsehood over truth, cruelty over mercy, hell over heaven. Their courage will rise as they think of you, only to faint as they think of me. Yet God is my witness I was just: I was merciful: I was faithful to my light: I could do no other than I did.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>scrambling out of the sheets and enthroning himself on the side of the bed</sd-in> Yes: it is always you good men that do the big mischiefs. Look at me! I am not Charles the Good, nor Charles the Wise, nor Charles the Bold. Joan’s worshippers may even call me Charles the Coward because I did not pull her out of the fire. But I have done less harm than any of you. You people with your heads in the sky spend all your time trying to turn the world upside down; but I take the world as it is, and say that top-side-up is right-side-up; and I keep my nose pretty close to the ground. And I ask you, what king of France has done better, or been a better fellow in his little way?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Art really king of France, Charlie? Be the English gone?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DUNOIS</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>coming through the tapestry on Joan’s left, the candles relighting themselves at the same moment, and illuminating his armor and surcoat cheerfully</sd-in> I have kept my word: the English are gone.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Praised be God! now is fair France a province in heaven. Tell me all about the fighting, Jack. Was it thou that led them? Wert thou God’s captain to thy death?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DUNOIS.</speaker>
				<speech>I am not dead. My body is very comfortably asleep in my bed at Chateaudun; but my spirit is called here by yours.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>And you fought them my way, Jack: eh? Not the old way, chaffering for ransoms; but The Maid’s way: staking life against death, with the heart high and humble and void of malice, and nothing counting under God but France free and French. Was it my way, Jack?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DUNOIS.</speaker>
				<speech>Faith, it was any way that would win. But the way that won was always your way. I give you best, lassie. I wrote a fine letter to set you right at the new trial. Perhaps I should never have let the priests burn you; but I was busy fighting; and it was the Church’s business, not mine. There was no use in both of us being burnt, was there?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Ay! put the blame on the priests. But I, who am beyond praise and blame, tell you that the world is saved neither by its priests nor its soldiers, but by God and His Saints. The Church Militant sent this woman to the fire; but even as she burnt, the flames whitened into the radiance of the Church Triumphant.</speech>

Tip top company too: emperors and popes and kings and all sorts. They chip me about giving that young judy the cross; but I <span class="nonstandard">dont</span> care: I stand up to them proper, and tell them that if she hadnt a better right to it than they, she’d be where they are. That dumbfounds them, that does. All they can do is gnash their teeth, hell fashion; and I just laugh, and go off singing the old chanty: Rum tum trumple⁠—Hullo! Who’s that knocking at the door?</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>They listen. A long gentle knocking is heard.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Come in.</speech>

			<sd-row>The door opens; and an old priest, white-haired, bent, with a silly but benevolent smile, comes in and trots over to Joan.</sd-row>

				<speaker>THE NEWCOMER.</speaker>
				<speech>Excuse me, gentle lords and ladies. Do not let me disturb you. Only a poor old harmless English rector. Formerly chaplain to the cardinal: to my lord of Winchester. John de Stogumber, at your service. <sd-in>He looks at them inquiringly</sd-in> Did you say anything? I am a little deaf, unfortunately. Also a little⁠—well, not always in my right mind, perhaps; but still, it is a small village with a few simple people. I suffice: I suffice: they love me there; and I am able to do a little good. I am well connected, you see; and they indulge me.</speech>

				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Poor old John! What brought thee to this state?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER.</speaker>
				<speech>I tell my folks they must be very careful. I say to them, “If you only saw what you think about you would think quite differently about it. It would give you a great shock. Oh, a great shock.” And they all say “Yes, parson: we all know you are a kind man, and would not harm a fly.” That is a great comfort to me. For I am not cruel by nature, you know.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE SOLDIER.</speaker>
				<speech>Who said you were?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER.</speaker>
				<speech>Well, you see, I did a very cruel thing once because I did not know what cruelty was like. I had not seen it, you know. That is the great thing: you must see it. And then you are redeemed and saved.</speech>

				<speech>Were not the sufferings of our Lord Christ enough for you?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER.</speaker>
				<speech>No. Oh no: not at all. I had seen them in pictures, and read of them in books, and been greatly moved by them, as I thought. But it was no use: it was not our Lord that redeemed me, but a young woman whom I saw actually burnt to death. It was dreadful: oh, most dreadful. But it saved me. I have been a different man ever since, though a little astray in my wits sometimes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>Must then a Christ perish in torment in every age to save those that have no imagination?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Well, if I saved all those he would have been cruel to if he had not been cruel to me, I was not burnt for nothing, was I?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, no; it was not you. My sight is bad: I cannot distinguish your features: but you are not she: oh no: she was burnt to a cinder: dead and gone, dead and gone.</speech>

				<speech><sd-in>stepping from behind the bed curtains on Charles’s right, the bed being between them</sd-in> She is more alive than you, old man. Her heart would not burn; and it would not drown. I was a master at my craft: better than the master of Paris, better than the master of Toulouse; but I could not kill The Maid. She is up and alive everywhere.</speech>

				<speaker>THE EARL OF WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>sallying from the bed curtains on the other side, and coming to Joan’s left hand</sd-in> Madame: my congratulations on your rehabilitation. I feel that I owe you an apology.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, please <span class="nonstandard">dont</span> mention it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>pleasantly</sd-in> The burning was purely political. There was no personal feeling against you, I assure you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>I bear no malice, my lord.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Just so. Very kind of you to meet me in that way: a touch of true breeding. But I must insist on apologizing very amply. The truth is, these political necessities sometimes turn out to be political mistakes; and this one was a veritable howler; for your spirit conquered us, madam, in spite of our faggots. History will remember me for your sake, though the incidents of the connection were perhaps a little unfortunate.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Ay, perhaps just a little, you funny man.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>Still, when they make you a saint, you will owe your halo to me, just as this lucky monarch owes his crown to you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>turning from him</sd-in> I shall owe nothing to any man: I owe everything to the spirit of God that was within me. But fancy me a saint! What would St. Catherine and St. Margaret say if the farm girl was cocked up beside them!</speech>

			<sd-row>A clerical-looking gentleman in black frockcoat and trousers, and tall hat, in the fashion of the year 1920, suddenly appears before them in the corner on their right. They all stare at him. Then they burst into uncontrollable laughter.</sd-row>

				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Why this mirth, gentlemen?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>I congratulate you on having invented a most extraordinarily comic dress.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>I do not understand. You are all in fancy dress: I am properly dressed.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DUNOIS.</speaker>
				<speech>All dress is fancy dress, is it not, except our natural skins?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Pardon me: I am here on serious business, and cannot engage in frivolous discussions. <sd-in>He takes out a paper, and assumes a dry official manner</sd-in>. I am sent to announce to you that Joan of Arc, formerly known as The Maid, having been the subject of an inquiry instituted by the Bishop of Orleans⁠—</speech>

				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>emphatically, to mark his indignation at the interruption</sd-in>⁠—by the Bishop of Orleans into the claim of the said Joan of Arc to be canonized as a saint⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>again interrupting</sd-in> But I never made any such claim.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>as before</sd-in>⁠—the Church has examined the claim exhaustively in the usual course, and, having admitted the said Joan successively to the ranks of Venerable and Blessed⁠—</speech>

				<speaker>JOAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>chuckling</sd-in> Me venerable!</speech>

				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>

				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>On every thirtieth day of May, being the anniversary of the death of the said most blessed daughter of God, there shall in every Catholic church to the end of time be celebrated a special office in commemoration of her; and it shall be lawful to dedicate a special chapel to her, and to place her image on its altar in every such church. And it shall be lawful and laudable for the faithful to kneel and address their prayers through her to the Mercy Seat.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh no. It is for the saint to kneel. <sd-in>She falls on her knees, still rapt</sd-in>.</speech>

				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER.</speaker>
				<speech>Sir: I was chaplain to the Cardinal of Winchester once. They always would call him the Cardinal of England. It would be a great comfort to me and to my master to see a fair statue to The Maid in Winchester Cathedral. Will they put one there, do you think?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>As the building is temporarily in the hands of the Anglican heresy, I cannot answer for that.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>A vision of the statue in Winchester Cathedral is seen through the window.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh look! look! that is Winchester.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Is that meant to be me? I was stiffer on my feet.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>The vision fades.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>I have been requested by the temporal authorities of France to mention that the multiplication of public statues to The Maid threatens to become an obstruction to traffic. I do so as a matter of courtesy to the said authorities, but must point out on behalf of the Church that The Maid’s horse is no greater obstruction to traffic than any other horse.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Eh! I am glad they have not forgotten my horse.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>A vision of the statue before Rheims Cathedral appears.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Is that funny little thing me too?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>That is Rheims Cathedral where you had me crowned. It must be you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Who has broken my sword? My sword was never broken. It is the sword of France.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DUNOIS.</speaker>
				<speech>Never mind. Swords can be mended. Your soul is unbroken; and you are the soul of France.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>The vision fades. The Archbishop and the Inquisitor are now seen on the right and left of Cauchon.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>My sword shall conquer yet: the sword that never struck a blow. Though men destroyed my body, yet in my soul I have seen God.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The girls in the field praise thee; for thou hast raised their eyes; and they see that there is nothing between them and heaven.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DUNOIS</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The dying soldiers praise thee, because thou art a shield of glory between them and the judgment.</speech>

			<line>
				<speaker>THE ARCHBISHOP</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The princes of the Church praise thee, because thou hast redeemed the faith their wordlinesses have dragged through the mire.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The cunning counsellors praise thee, because thou hast cut the knots in which they have tied their own souls.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The foolish old men on their deathbeds praise thee, because their sins against thee are turned into blessings.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE INQUISITOR</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The judges in the blindness and bondage of the law praise thee, because thou hast vindicated the vision and the freedom of the living soul.</speech>

				<speaker>THE SOLDIER</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The wicked out of hell praise thee, because thou hast shewn them that the fire that is not quenched is a holy fire.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE EXECUTIONER</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The tormentors and executioners praise thee, because thou hast shewn that their hands are guiltless of the death of the soul.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>kneeling to her</sd-in> The unpretending praise thee, because thou hast taken upon thyself the heroic burdens that are too heavy for them.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>Woe unto me when all men praise me! I bid you remember that I am a saint, and that saints can work miracles. And now tell me: shall I rise from the dead, and come back to you a living woman?</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>A sudden darkness blots out the walls of the room as they all spring to their feet in consternation. Only the figures and the bed remain visible.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>What! Must I burn again? Are none of you ready to receive me?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CAUCHON.</speaker>
				<speech>The heretic is always better dead. And mortal eyes cannot distinguish the saint from the heretic. Spare them. <sd-in>He goes out as he came</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DUNOIS.</speaker>
				<speech>Forgive us, Joan: we are not yet good enough for you. I shall go back to my bed. <sd-in>He also goes</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
				<speech>We sincerely regret our little mistake; but political necessities, though occasionally erroneous, are still imperative; so if you will be good enough to excuse me⁠—<sd-in>He steals discreetly away</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE ARCHBISHOP.</speaker>
				<speech>Your return would not make me the man you once thought me. The utmost I can say is that though I dare not bless you, I hope I may one day enter into your blessedness. Meanwhile, however⁠—<sd-in>He goes</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE INQUISITOR.</speaker>
				<speech>I who am of the dead, testified that day that you were innocent. But I do not see how The Inquisition could possibly be dispensed with under existing circumstances. Therefore⁠—<sd-in>He goes</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>DE STOGUMBER.</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, do not come back: you must not come back. I must die in peace. Give us peace in our time, O Lord! <sd-in>He goes</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
				<speech>The possibility of your resurrection was not contemplated in the recent proceedings for your canonization. I must return to Rome for fresh instructions. <sd-in>He bows formally, and withdraws</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE EXECUTIONER.</speaker>
				<speech>As a master in my profession I have to consider its interest. And, after all, my first duty is to my wife and children. I must have time to think over this. <sd-in>He goes</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
				<speech>Poor old Joan! They have all run away from you except this blackguard who has to go back to hell at twelve o’clock. And what can I do but follow Jack Dunois’ example, and go back to bed too? <sd-in>He does so</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>sadly</sd-in> Good night, Charlie.</speech>

				<speech><sd-in>mumbling in his pillows</sd-in> Goo ni. <sd-in>He sleeps. The darkness envelopes the bed</sd-in>.</speech>

				<speaker>JOAN</speaker>
				<speech><sd-in>to the soldier</sd-in> And you, my one faithful? What comfort have you for Saint Joan?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>THE SOLDIER.</speaker>
				<speech>Well, what do they all amount to, these kings and captains and bishops and lawyers and such like? They just leave you in the ditch to bleed to death; and the next thing is, you meet them down there, for all the airs they give themselves. What I say is, you have as good a right to your notions as they have to theirs, and perhaps better. <sd-in>Settling himself for a lecture on the subject</sd-in> You see, it’s like this. If⁠—<sd-in>the first stroke of midnight is heard softly from a distant bell</sd-in>. Excuse me: a pressing appointment⁠—<sd-in>He goes on tiptoe</sd-in>.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-row>The last remaining rays of light gather into a white radiance descending on Joan. The hour continues to strike.</sd-row>
			<line>
				<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
				<speech>O God that madest this beautiful earth, when will it be ready to receive Thy saints? How long, O Lord, how long?</speech>
