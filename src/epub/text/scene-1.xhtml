			</h2>
			<p>A fine spring morning on the river Meuse, between Lorraine and Champagne, in the year 1429 <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr>, in the castle of Vaucouleurs.</p>
			<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Captain Robert de Baudricourt</b>, a military squire, handsome and physically energetic, but with no will of his own, is disguising that defect in his usual fashion by storming terribly at his <b epub:type="z3998:persona">steward</b>, a trodden worm, scanty of flesh, scanty of hair, who might be any age from 18 to 55, being the sort of man whom age cannot wither because he has never bloomed.</p>
			<p>The two are in a sunny stone chamber on the first floor of the castle. At a plain strong oak table, seated in chair to match, the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">captain</b> presents his left profile. The <b epub:type="z3998:persona">steward</b> stands facing him at the other side of the table, if so deprecatory a stance as his can be called standing. The mullioned thirteenth-century window is open behind him. Near it in the corner is a turret with a narrow arched doorway leading to a winding stair which descends to the courtyard. There is a stout fourlegged stool under the table, and a wooden chest under the window.</p>

Not a gentleman farmer: he makes money by it, and lives by it. Still, not a laborer. Not a mechanic. He might have a cousin a lawyer, or in the Church.
